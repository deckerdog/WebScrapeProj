So there is still life to the leg and the specialists at NYU believe they can save it. ,Pajtim’s whole life has been dedicated to fitness and the outdoors. He works out religiously and treats his body like his temple, never smoking nor drinking, which is why doctors believe he’s beating the odds right now. ,He’s a fighter. And we’re trying to give him a fighter’s chance. We’re hoping with these additional surgeries that he will not only save the leg, but work hard afterward to regain some of the joys he once lived daily. ,If you can help us offset some of Pajtim’s extraordinary medical costs, and hopefully save his leg, it would mean so much.

                        ,: Many fundraisers have been put into place to raise funds for the Stoy Family to cover the cost of the transplant. Nearly a month into fundraising, Olivia's story had reached so many people that the initial goal was met! $350,000 was the cost of the initial procedure and , include additional treatment: hospital stays longer than the allotted 50 days, medications, time off of work, and travel expenses. Depending on how fast Olivia's health progresses after the transplant, additional bills could add up fast. ,Now, Olivia wants to use this experience to bring light to childhood cancer and raise additional money for other children in medical battles of their own. As a result, she created , , a campaign designed to shed light on the struggles of childhood cancer through her own personal experiences and those of families she has met along the way. In an effort to help her through the recovery process, Olivia wants to raise $1 million for Liv It Up, to help give young cancer patients a chance at being a kid and their parents the peace of mind that they will have help paying for life-saving medical treatments like Olivia's.,Olivia Stoy was an active 12 year old girl, finishing her first year at Angola Middle School. What was thought to be a lingering cold turned out to be something much more serious. Olivia was sent from a local hospital to Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis and was eventually diagnosed with ,.  Right away, her team of doctors worked on her treatment plan.  Of course, there were a few bumps in the road: a chemo medication that at normal strength caused Olivia to have seizures; an infection which meant an automatic 2 week stay in the hospital; not to mention all of the trips to and from Riley in between those events.  But after all the ups and downs on February 14, 2017 Olivia was declared cancer free but would need to continue treatments through September 2018 to increase the chances of her cancer not returning.,During this time, many people asked how they could help, how could they donate. The Stoy family was not in need of funds at the time and Olivia wanted to make sure other kids could benefit from the work of the Child Life Specialists at Riley and Cancer Research. All money was directed to the Riley Foundation where Olivia chose it’s route. To date, over $50,000 has been donated to Riley in Olivia’s name. ,In March 2018, just one year after celebrating Olivia being cancer free, Olivia’s cancer returned. It was devastating for all who followed her story. Right away the doctors at Riley worked on a plan for Olivia’s relapse. The plan consisted of several rounds of chemotherapy and once the cancer is gone a bone marrow transplant will be needed. After testing members of Olivia’s immediate family, her brother was found to be a 100% match! The Stoy family is part of a faith sharing insurance plan that does not cover organ transplants, including bone marrow transplants. While the family has appealed to the insurance board, on May 14, 2018 the sharing/insurance plan , which is the recommended treatment option by doctors at Riley Hospital for Olivia’s survival.,We are fundraising for the Stoy Family to help cover the cost of the bone marrow transplant. The original estimate is $900,000. The family has negotiated a price with the hospital and , before for the bone marrow transplant can take place which is estimated to begin ,. Should any complication arise during Olivia’s treatment additional funds will be needed. If funds are raised that exceed the amount needed for the bone marrow transplant, the hope is that this fund can provide to other childhood cancer patients and their families for years to come in honor of Olivia Stoy, a true fighter and inspiration to so many!,Tax deductible checks can be made out to “Liv it Up” and mailed to Pleasant Lake Mennonite Church | c/o Liv It Up | 5142 S.

                        ,￼￼￼￼,Esther was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 26 in early 2016. ,Her rare form of cancer puts her in a situation where conventional medicine cannot help her any further.,She is pursuing alternate treatment at the , near San Diego where she will start receiving the intensive, targeted treatments her body is needing now more than ever. These treatments will strengthen her immune system as well as help it to recognize the cancerous cells in order to overcome them. ,She is scheduled to begin on Monday, May 7th, and will be needing the funds by May 27th at the latest.  Her father, Rick Ridings, is overseeing this account, withdrawals, and payments.  On May 8th, we increased the goal to $50,000 as they have now recommended extra treatments and continuing care. This is an urgent need and any amount you are able to contribute to her life is deeply appreciated! ,Please share this page and spread the word for this. Thank you! ,For more details, see below.,Read more of Esther's story on her blog:, ,Hi, I’m Esther Moore. I’m a mother, musician, a writer and blogger. I’m married to William Moore and we have a gorgeous little four year old boy who happens to have Down Syndrome. ,￼￼￼￼,About a year and a half after finding out Levy’s surprise diagnosis at birth, I was told at the age of 26 that my body was fighting a very aggressive, fast growing type of cancer  - triple negative breast cancer, one of the hardest to treat conventionally. I had two surgeries, an extensive one where they took out all my lymph nodes in my left arm and another when I found a second lump under my arm a few months later. ,￼￼￼￼,Then, I found a third lump - the third time the cancer had recurred within 9 months. At this point the doctors told me that they wouldn’t recommend surgery, because it would just keep coming back. They said that unfortunately, since it had shown to be so aggressive and recurring, any treatment they could give me like chemo and radiation would most likely only be palliative (just have a small chance of even extending my life), not curative. It was devastating to hear. ,After the surgeon told me it was now inoperable and that there was nothing else they could offer me that would be curative, we prayed about it and decided to move back from the UK to the place I had grown up to be near family - Jerusalem, Israel. ,I’ve been following an intensive natural/alternative treatment plan since the beginning that has helped a huge amount. We also have been blown away by how many people around the world have been praying for us and believing with us for total healing, that we believe has made a huge difference. Thankfully, this seemed to help delay the cancer spreading since the oncologist told me back in October 2016 that it would have spread to all my major organs within the next three months. Up until recently, it miraculously hadn’t spread at all and was still contained to the area under my arm. ,Recently, I’ve been in a lot more intense constant pain. My left arm has also become swollen, painful and unusable with symptoms of lymphedema (common after the surgery I had). We decided to go to the hospital here to see if anything could be done. After what felt like a million tests, scans and long days at the hospital, we found out the results...and they were not what we were hoping for. It showed that the cancer now had started to spread throughout my lymphatic system, and that they had also found a small mass on one of my vertebrae bones. It was so hard to hear, but we’re thankful that it hasn’t spread further and has not spread to any organs. Still, we knew something had to be done. ,Although this would now class it as stage four cancer, the doctors at the hospital said there was still hope. They told us there is a new cancer treatment called immunotherapy, a treatment that supercharges the immune system to fight against the cancer itself that has had incredible results - even for people with stage 4 cancer. ,After a lot of prayer and research and talking things through, we decided to look at clinics that specialise in this treatment. We found one near San Diego called the ,  that offers immunotherapy along with all of the intensive, non toxic treatments that I have researched and been wanting to do.  There are case studies of people who did these treatments at this Center who had ,  and had incredible results - even going home cancer free. The center combines the latest cutting edge medical treatments with holistic, natural non-toxic therapies to get the best results. From ,  it looks like they have helped thousands of people, many with stage 4 cancer, to massively improve and often become cancer free. ,Within a couple days of finding the clinic and it being confirmed to us that this seemed to be the next step, everything miraculously fell into place faster than we could have imagined. I’ll be flying out today (!!) to start treatment this Monday, the 7th of May.  We strongly feel that this is my best chance at getting my life back and being here for our son and future children. ,But, we need your help. All together the costs come to 30,000 US dollars for a three week treatment. Many people in my situation have had incredible results even in these three weeks, but included in this cost is a detailed intensive home treatment plan provided by the clinic for at least three months afterwards as well. We’re so thankful for the incredible support network we’ve had around us from the beginning from all over the world, and appreciate anything you can do to help us meet our goal by donating and/or sharing this page. Thank you for helping me conquer this cancer!

                        This GoFundMe Page is being established to provide financial support for the immediate family of Robert E. Jeans, Jr., who passed away tragically in an automobile accident on June 15, 2018.    He was 42 years of age.     ,Bob, or “Junior” as he was known colloquially, was a larger-than-life inimitable personality who impacted everyone he came across through his generosity and warm demeanor.    Growing up in a tight-knit family in Kenilworth, NJ, which is known as a “Community of Strength”, Bob attended David Brearley High School before graduating from Arthur L. Johnson High School, and went on to study finance at the University of South Carolina, earning a degree in 1999.,If you were lucky enough to know Bob Jeans, then without a doubt you experienced the joy he could bring into your life. The pleasure of his company alone would improve your outlook, charging a room with boundless positive energy.  In this sense, Bob was a rare person.  Bob was given a gift, a remarkable talent to connect with people through the lost art of human touch; a rare skill in today’s technology-driven, impersonal world.   He capitalized on these skills to build a tremendously successful 18-year career with PGIM Real Estate; and create lasting, meaningful friendships and partnerships with nearly every person who interfaced with him.,Bob was the all the best things in life and brought out the best among us. He was larger than life and had the ability to impact everyone he came across through his generosity and warm demeanor. Bob grew to become an essential figurehead within the social fabric of the New Jersey wrestling community, the Kenilworth Veterans Center, and the commercial real estate industry. Most importantly, Bob was the patriarch of his adoring family of his wife, Kristen, his children, McKenna, Emerson and Declan, the son to his loving parents Lenore and Robert Jeans Sr., and the brother to his caring sister Stacie; in addition to being apart of a large, loving extended family.

                        ,Brian Hughes was loved by everyone he met. He was a funny, enthusiastic, outgoing and all around an amazing human being. His fellow Arrowhead Interagency Hotshots would say he was a great leader who was an iconic Hotshot and was more than just a friend, he was a brother, mentor, and motivator. Brian tragically passed away in the line of duty on July 29, 2018 while battling the Ferguson Fire in Mariposa County. He is survived by his parents, sister, and fiancé who is 3 months pregnant with their first child, as well as their 2 dogs Zephyr and Taco. He was excited and nervous to be a father and would go around asking the other fathers on the crew for some fatherly advice. He loved Paige and his family very much. Brian is a hero who not only gave his life fighting fires but gave back to our country by saving lives and property countless times through his 15 year career. Brian worked all around the country doing what he loved, Alaska Fire Service, Monterey Hand Crew, Rosevelt Hotshots, Midnight Sons Hotshots, and the Larimer County Yellow Jackets to name a few. The Arrowhead family would now like to ask the community to come together to help support his family. All donations will be given directly to his Fiancé Paige and their unborn child to help with anything they might need in their future.

                        Rwanda is a country of children with no children's hospital.  Join us to help build the first children's hospital in Rwanda.,Rwanda is a rapidly developing country, with a population dominated by children. The mortality rate among these children has been reduced by half by delivering basic health care to all. But to take the next leap forward, more advanced levels of care must also become available. With only one pediatrician for every 68,000 children, and mothers and children still dying from preventable causes, the next leap forward in Rwandan health care requires more pediatricians and pediatric subspecialists as well as strong technological development and a dedicated place to provide the care. ,Nyanja Brodin is an advocate of vulnerable children and is committed to the development of her country of Rwanda.  Together with her husband Petter Brodin (a pediatrician and accomplished researcher) and her friend, Melina Patterson (an attorney), Nyanja formed Little Hills to work together with the Rwandan community to increase the quality of care for mothers and children in Rwanda.,With your support, the Little Hills projects will improve the quality of health care for mothers and children in Rwanda.  Funds raised by Little Hills will go towards:,·         Costs associated with bringing volunteer physicians and nurses to Rwanda, including housing, transportation, and other related costs;,·         Scholarships for disadvantaged Rwandan women to attend medical school;,·         Costs related to planning the construction of the hospital; and,·         Any money raised in excess of the above costs will go towards the construction of the hospital.,For more information, visit  ,Follow us on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter at @littlehillsorg,Little Hills is a nonprofit organization incorporated in California as Tiny Hills, Inc.

                        Michael Duke tragically passed away this past Sunday, October 7th, leaving behind his wife, daughter, parents, siblings, and countless friends. Mike’s loves of his life were his wife Andrea, and his daughter Emma.  He was a fantastic husband and an even better father.  With Emma just 11 months old, we are hoping to raise money to establish an educational fund to support her for years to come. His number one wish in life was to make sure his daughter was secure and we intend to help indefinitely to honor him. Mike also put a great value on education, and nothing would keep his memory alive more than your contribution to get this fund launched.,Those of you fortunate enough to know Mike knew that he was thoughtful and never one to waste words, but he was especially soft-spoken when it came to talking about himself. He certainly never sought attention, but instead always looked to build up others. He was exceptionally kind-hearted and looked to help in any way possible. Mike has already touched many lives even after his passing.  It was important to him and his wife Andrea that they would be organ donors, and Mike’s heart has already been transplanted and saved someone else’s life.  His other organs are on flights to different parts of the United States where they will be transplanted this week. This is how Mike would want to be remembered, as someone who was always willing to put others before himself, even beyond his life.,Mike was also a major benefactor at the Nativity Preparatory School in Wilmington, Delaware. This school is part of a nation-wide network of tuition-free middle schools serving low-income families. The school was launched in Wilmington, Delaware and is sponsored and created by Mike’s High School, Salesianum School, also located in Wilmington, Delaware. Mike was a large supporter of sponsored scholarships for students throughout his professional life.,Mike was also beloved by his co-workers. Mike started at G.X Clarke & Co. interning in the summer of 2008, and after graduation in 3.5 years from Villanova University, started at G.X. Clarke and Co. in January of 2009 as a bond trader.  Mike was one of the key pieces in the exponential growth of the Securitized Products Desk at G.X. Clarke & Co., eventually becoming INTL FCStone Inc. in 2015.  Just last winter, Mike was appointed Head of Securitized Trading at the young age of 31. An incredible feat for an incredible man.,What many of you may not know, the small group we had at G.X. Clarke & Co. and now at INTL FCStone has been together and worked with Mike for the last 10 years.  With the open-floored structure of a trading desk, our team is like family. Beyond titles and accolades, one could walk around our trading floor and unequivocally every person would say that Mike was the smartest person in the room, the most impressive, and the sounding board that we all cherished. He was the rock that we all needed, and will be missed beyond belief.,Emma and Andrea were Mike’s everything.  Mike’s greatest life goal would be the security of his daughter and her education, and we believe this to be the best way to honor a great man. We ask that if you can, please donate to Emma’s educational fund as it would be Michael’s number one wish.

He was just 36 years old (DOB 07/02/1982) and survived by wife Devi, daughter Keerthi (8 years) and son Krithik (4 years). When he had the stroke, he went to the park with his son and was on a last lap of his evening walk. He was immediately taken to Washington Hospital in Fremont but unfortunately did not survive.,Subhash was a Software Engineer working as a consultant for Apple in Sunnyvale, CA and is from Kacharam village near Shamshabad, Telangana state in India. He was a hard working professional and family person. Very recently he bought a house in Fremont and shared his happy moments with all of us. Unfortunately, all his dreams were disappeared just with a stroke and left his family in a situation where no one should be.,We, friends, who were touched by his caring and helpful nature, are actively working with family members and other friends along with appropriate organizations/authorities to make necessary arrangements for his last rites and organizing this fund raising campaign to support the family at this difficult time.,Appreciate, if you could support his family by making a donation and share this message to your Friends and Families. This will greatly help his family with funeral and his young kids education.,THANK YOU in advance for your generosity.,[Added on 10/15/2018],My name is Sudhamsh Dandamraj along with Satish Mailapuram (friend), Sudharshan Anugu (Subhash's cousin) and few other friends, organizing this fund raising campaign to help Subhash's family. We were neighbors for almost 6 years and our kids grew up together. Our families were closely knitted families with a great love and respect.,The funds raised will be used to meet some immediate expenses i.e. related to funeral, family's travel to India, transportation of the body to his native India and funeral expenses there. They will also be used to support kids Education now and in future.  Since Subhash is the source of income for the family, some of the funds will also be allocated to meet family's monthly expenses.,Currently, Subhash's cousin overseeing the funds until, his wife Devi will be able to handle the matters for herself.,- Sudhamsh, Satish & Sudharshan

                        Hi Everyone, , I, along with my friend Daniel Achber, am trying to raise upwards of $100,000 to support six human rights defenders and their families who have had to flee for their lives, or have been killed, because of their involvement in human rights research and activism. Among these families are more than three dozen children. These human rights defenders were and are extraordinarily impressive and brave people who have suffered greatly in the defence of noble causes, and the money we raise will go a long way toward helping them and their families out of extremely difficult situations. 100% of the donations will go directly to the human rights defenders and their families. There will be no tax receipt. ,Please read below for more information on the cause, how you can help, and the 1000-mile canoe race I’m participating in to encourage further support., As some of you know, for more than a decade I have been working in the field of international affairs, supporting conflict-resolution efforts and investigating war crimes and other serious violations of human rights. During this time, I have met – and in several instances worked closely with – extraordinary individuals, from conflict-affected populations, who risk their lives in the fight for peace, justice, and human rights. ,Unlike me, and other expats who work for international organizations, these local human rights defenders do not have the luxury of being able to criticize the unlawful and immoral behavior of governments and non-state groups and then retreat to the safety of North America or Europe, beyond the reach of the violent actors whose behavior they have criticized. Rather, they often choose to remain, or have no choice but to remain, in areas where they are at constant risk for arrest, detention, torture, and death because of their work. Perversely, the risks they face are often elevated by their association (or their perceived association) with international human rights organizations or journalists. Each year, scores of human rights defenders living in authoritarian countries around the world are arrested, tortured, disappeared and killed, and numerous others are forced to flee their homes, often to foreign countries where they remain at risk with little or no physical or legal protections.  ,  I am trying to raise money to support four human rights defenders and their families, and the families of two other human rights defenders who were killed.  Each of the four survivors is currently in hiding from their respective governments so I cannot provide you with their names or biographical details, but I can briefly describe their situations.  ,One individual is a former colleague of mine from Darfur, Sudan, who worked closely with me over several years to document crimes against humanity by Sudanese government forces, including mass killings, widespread sexual violence, and allegations of chemical weapons use.  As a result of this work and his work with other human rights organizations, he and his family have twice been forced to flee for their lives. He is now in the US where he is in the process of applying for asylum and trying to restart his life. In addition to providing for his own immediate family, he is responsible for financially supporting five war orphans from Darfur, Sudan who come from his home area and are currently living in Chad. ,Two individuals, one of whom was a nurse who cared for victims of violence, worked closely with me and my abovementioned colleague to unearth evidence of unlawful attacks, before being killed in attacks. ,Two other individuals were forced to flee their home countries as a result of their work as human rights activists and are currently hiding in a neighbouring country where their lives remain at risk. ,Finally, another individual was arrested and tortured for his work as a human rights activist. After significant political pressure was placed on his government, he was released from prison; his life remains at risk and he has been forced to flee to a neighbouring country. , 100% of the donations will go directly to the human rights defenders and their families. The money will be divided (according to need) among the six families, which, between them, have more than three dozen children.   All donations will go directly to the individuals and their families, to be used entirely at their discretion. For the families of the deceased, the money will largely go to pay for food, healthcare, and other basic necessities. For the family who has made it to the US, the money will also be used for necessities and job training, as well as to support the war orphans in Chad. For the people who are still in hiding, the money will go to help with costs to relocate to safer places. ,. The money will be transferred by me to the individuals via check or Western Union. , In keeping with a decidedly odd cultural norm of the society that I inhabit, I am trying to increase donations by participating in an inarguably bizarre athletic competition. Because if history has taught us anything, and it hasn’t, it’s that people in wealthy countries are more likely to donate to serious causes if they are in some way linked to comically unnecessary displays of physical strength and endurance. To this end, I have enlisted the support of my most seaworthy friend, Daniel, and decided to partake in the most stereotypically Canadian activity we could find… ,This, of course, is the world’s longest canoe race, the Yukon 1000 (yukon1000.org): a 1,000-mile (1,600 km), completely unsupported race down the majestic and splendidly isolated Yukon River from the town of Whitehorse in the Yukon in northwestern Canada to a remote bridge on the outskirts of Fairbanks, Alaska. The race will begin on Sunday, July 22. As may or may not be customary in such events, any efforts at communicating with the outside world during the race will result in our immediate disqualification/immense shame; however, those who decide to donate will have the unique privilege of being provided with a link to a webpage that will be tracking the progress of our trusty satellite beacon, thus allowing you to partake in the immeasurably pleasurable act of continuously monitoring our progress against our many almost assuredly strange yet wonderful adversaries .    ,Needless to say, none of the donations will be contingent on us finishing, let alone winning, the race. That said, Daniel is an excellent photographer, and I’m inarguably an expert at pointing out moose and telling him to photograph them. He has offered to provide prints of his pictures to anyone who donates (in quantity and dimensions that we deem commensurate with the size of your donation). So if you want to support human rights defenders, or if you want a well-composed picture of the unspoiled Canadian wilderness, or both, then this is your opportunity!, These are extraordinarily impressive and brave people who have suffered greatly in the defence of very noble causes.  The money will go a long way toward helping them out of extremely difficult situations. ,If anyone has any questions, please feel free contact me at any time. ,Thank you very much!,Jonathan Loeb

                        On Sunday, July 29th, lightning struck our beloved Meadowbrook Waldorf School and started a devastating fire. Despite the efforts of more than 250 fire fighters, the building that was home to students in the nursery through grade 8 and many alumni from years past is now a total loss.,On September 4th, we welcomed the students back for another year of school work. Thanks to the ingenuity of our parent volunteers, and the flexibility of our teachers, we have turned our rented accommodation into a home away from home where the kindergarten and nursery children can bake bread and play outdoors in all kinds of weather. The older students are immersed in their studies of local geography and the Roman Empire, the Renaissance and the Industrial Revolution. We are immensely grateful for the thousands of donations, from gently used desks and chalkboards to library books and crayons, that  enabled us to start school on time.  ,
,Now, our community has shifted its focus to rebuilding the school. While we have achieved our initial goal of $150,000, we now know that we need $1.75 million to complete this rebuilding project. The lease on our temporary space is for one year and, although we have an option to extend for  a further year, our time line must be aggressive if we are to be successful.  If all goes well, construction will begin in early 2019 and we will be able to welcome the children home in January, 2020.,Above, pre-school teacher Su Rubinoff , office manager Jacquelyn Coker, and rising grade 8 teacher Kristina Boving -  making sandwiches for the incredible emergency responders.,This is a huge undertaking for our small school and we need your help. Our families rolled up their sleeves and cleared away the remains of the destroyed building and now they are ready to swing hammers and paint walls - just as they did for the building we lost. Current and alumni parents are volunteering their time and professional expertise to help design the new building and to guide the construction process. We are working with local businesses including building contractors, and we continue looking for opportunities to be good community partners. We are  aware that how we work is as important for the children as the building we create, and that putting our values into action to accomplish our goals is part of our students' education., We hope that you will join us on this journey so that we can continue our mission of preparing children to become resourceful, enterprising, creative and independent thinkers. Please help us rebuild our school for the young people who will shape the future of the world we share.  Thank You! ,From , , serving all of Rhode Island and SE Connecticut. ,MWS is a 501(3)c non-profit organization and your gift may be tax deductible. To request a tax receipt letter, please submit the donor name and mailing address via the link on the Meadowbrook Waldorf School website home page.

                        ,August 22, 2018,Dear Friends, ,Our beloved Dorian Caster tragically passed away on Friday, July 20. Dorian was a kind and caring soul with a beautiful and infectious energy.  He was passionate about life and this world, and he captured this compellingly through the lens of his camera. He was a loving husband to his wife, Corrie, and devoted father to their children Kai and Rio. He loved his family and friends deeply and unconditionally, and anyone who had the opportunity to meet Dorian can attest to the remarkable ways in which he touched everyone’s lives. ,For those of you who don’t know, Dorian suffered from unmanaged depression for many years. Though his death feels nearly incomprehensible, it is also a painful yet important reminder that mental illness is often an unseen struggle, and speaks powerfully to the disparity between one’s public portrayal and their own private realities. It is Corrie’s hope that Dorian’s memory will prompt a greater awareness of mental health, as suicide is a painful and complicated topic that we all must address if we are to respect the lives lost.,In recognition of Dorian’s battle with mental illness, we must all consider the consequences that this struggle has on his family. While each of us has felt the impact of losing our dear friend far too soon, the life-altering ramifications his children will experience as a result of this tragedy is unthinkable. The unfortunate reality is that while we grieve alongside them, the aftermath of this adversity has the capacity to transform the trajectory of their lives. Before they can truly grieve, they must face some very daunting questions: can we remain in our house and how will we pay the bills? Will this tragedy limit what we can achieve in our own lives? Therefore — we must collectively take action and help answer these questions. We must ensure Kai and Rio have the ability to choose the course of their own lives rather than having that course forced upon them. ,These are wildly talented, kind and caring boys, and I promise you that assisting them as they move forward with their lives is an investment in a better world. ,I ask you all to please join me and consider donating to this vital cause.,Sincerely, ,Taylor Sheridan ,Contributions to this fundraiser will be used for:,- Grief and trauma therapy for the family,- Shelter (so the family can remain in their home),- Food and basic living needs,- Health care and health insurance,- Rio’s education (he has two more years of high school and hopes to attend a higher education program),For more information on this campaign, please feel free to contact CorrieKaiRioCaster@gmail.com.,

                        Our father, husband, uncle, son, and friend, Jaime Lebron Jr. had scheduled routine surgery to remove a narrow piece in his colon on Wednesday June 13th, 2018. 18 hours later, returning from his surgery, Jaime began to express indescribable pain Thursday afternoon, June 14th. Early Friday morning June 15 at 12am, 12 hours after first expressing the unbearable pain, Jamie was rushed back in for an emergency 2nd surgery.  ,Doctors discovered that the staples reconnecting his colon, had came out and feces in colon had been escaping into his body. The second surgery they did their best to clean out the intestinal spill and reconnect the colon again. By this time, Jaime had reached septic shock. As time went on, the infection had spread to his heart and his body could not pump enough blood to all parts of his body. His heart went into an arithmetic pattern and became weaker by the minute. ,The doctors assured our family that they had done all that they could for Jaime but the infection had just spread to widely in his body that he could not come back to beat the infection and that there was nothing else they could do for him. Our family decided to unplug the machine helping him breath and left the rest in God’s hands to let him naturally go on his own. ,On Sunday, June 17th, 2018 at 1:45am Jamie Lebron Jr had passed. It was Father’s Day. ,Jaime was a son, a brother, an uncle, a husband, and a father of four daughters. Jaime was a faculty member of the Scarsdale School District for 27 years, and a well-known and active member in the Scarsdale community. ,If you knew Jaime you know he was a can-do man. There was nothing that he couldn't get done. His wife and daughters were his whole world. They were his everything, that he did anything for. He was friendly, generous and spirited. He was a strong man that worked hard to give his family everything that he could and that they deserved. Jaime worked hard to provide for his family and to make sure to see all four of his daughters grow to be strong, independent and educated black woman. He worked hard to make sure that his daughters could move on to receive an education at any college of their choice that they felt they would be able to flourish in. ,With his lost, we want to continue to work hard for what he spent his whole life working for; to see his daughters prosper in life. Please join in our goal to keep Jaime’s legacy, hopes and dreams alive by donating to his girl’s college scholarship fund. ,Anything is appreciated and will be saved to support Aiyana and Juliana’s education. Funds also will allow us to transition our lives after our loss, helping with our living arrangements, moving costs, medical, lawyer and funeral expenses. PLEASE SHARE WITH #JAIMESGIRLS #GOFUNDME

                        ,Right now, more than 98 million adolescent girls worldwide are not in school. That’s why the Global Girls Alliance, a program of the Obama Foundation, is teaming up with GoFundMe to encourage people around the world to take action by helping to break down the barriers that keep girls from fulfilling their potential.,Some of these barriers are child marriage or early pregnancy. But often they are attitudes and beliefs—the belief that girls simply aren’t worthy of an education; that women should have no role outside the home; and that their bodies aren’t their own, their minds don’t really matter, and their voices shouldn’t be heard.,When we invest in girls’ education, it doesn’t just benefit them—it benefits all of us. An educated girl can lift up her family, her community, and her country. When girls get the opportunities they deserve, amazing things start to happen. Poverty goes down, economies grow, families get stronger, babies are born healthier, and the world, by all accounts, gets better.,Your support can help begin to remove some of these obstacles by providing tools, resources, and support to organizations on the ground working to change the lives of girls around the world. Donations made to the Global Girls Alliance Fund will go toward projects ranging from mentoring girls in Uganda to hiring educators in India to covering school-related expenses for girls in Guatemala. The paths and techniques to support these girls may be different, but they all share a common goal: ,Stay tuned here for updates on the Global Girls Alliance Fund and how it is making an impact on girls education around the world. ,To learn more about the Global Girls Alliance, a program of the Obama Foundation that seeks to empower adolescent girls around the world through education, head to GlobalGirlsAlliance.org.,______________________,

To our great sadness, on May 31 at 2:52pm, surrounded by his friends and family and with members of the Cape Coral Fire Department standing vigil, Engineer Camelo succumbed to the effects of the aneurysm.,Engineer Camelo began his career as a firefighter with the Cape Coral Fire Department on February 27, 2006. On February 10, 2018 he was promoted to Fire Engineer/Driver. He was a Paramedic, a Hazardous Materials Technician, a Public Safety Boat Operator, a member of the Firefighter Survival and Rapid Intervention Team, and served on the Honor Guard.  ,Engineer Camelo was committed to continuing his education and ensuring he stayed apprised of advancements in the fire service. He received an A.S. in Fire Service from Columbia Southern University in 2017. He had his Fire Officer I, Fire Safety Inspector I, Instructor I, and Live Fire Training Instructor I certifications. Most recently he was the recipient of a full scholarship to attend the Fire Department Instructors Conference (FDIC) International in Indianapolis, IN in April.,Engineer Camelo’s enthusiasm for training had reaches far beyond the Cape Coral Fire Department. He was a Basic Life Support (BLS) Instructor, teaching countless citizens the lifesaving procedure of CPR. He was a beloved instructor for the Cape Coral Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) and, since 2013, was an instructor at the Fort Myers Fire Academy.,While these are all impressive accomplishments, Engineer Camelo was, most importantly, a Brother. Engineer Camelo genuinely cared about the community and his fellow Brothers and Sisters. All of us are deeply saddened by his untimely death. This is not only a great loss to the CCFD and his family, but to the entire Southwest Florida community.,Engineer Camelo leaves behind two children, his daughter Anna, 5, and his son Michael Camelo III, 3. Any received donations will go toward their future.,Fraternally, ,President Chudzik, IAFF Local 2424

                        Mia is a young pittie mix that was carelessly dumped on the side of the road in Southwest Philadelphia. She was left emaciated, dirty and scared, left to die. She barely had the energy or life in her to hold her head up. In passing, she looked deceased.  We were alerted of Mias situation, but were unable to get to her before Animal Control. Animal Control seized her and took her to their facility. We contacted Animal Control, where they agreed to release Mia into our custody, as she started vomitting and her already deteriorated condition was starting to decline. ,We rushed her to Wissahickon Creek Veterinary Clinic as she clung on to life.  once we arrived at the vet, it was quickly discovered  that Mia needed a blood transfusion ASAP.  Mia and currently at Wissahickon Vet receiving fluids and will be receiving blood soon. Further testing will be done to determine the best course of treatment to ensure she will start to gain weight in a healthy way. Mia has a very long road ahead of her. This is the worst case of starvation we have every dealt with. She will be required to stay in the hospital for several days. Please consider donating toward her care so Mia can have the second chance at life that she so very much deserves.

                        ,Out of control puppy breeding in Northern California of Northern Breed mixes has been ordered to shut down. The dogs are not being fed and will starve to death without funds to pay for food. We are in the process of finding organizations to help place these gorgeous animals to prevent them from being euthanized by the local authorities.,Many dogs are not neutered or spayed and continue to produce puppies making this situation more precarious. Currently, we have over 30 puppies that need homes with two litters on the way so most likely 40+ puppies that will need to be saved.,We need funds to pay for fixing all the animals to prevent breeding. Once fixed and assessed we will be adopting out to homes and sanctuaries. We are not charging a fee to adopt these animals however each potential adopter must fill out an application first.,The dogs are being kept in cages and pens with no ability to stop their breeding and are in unhealthy conditions. Two new litters were birthed just a few days ago and two more females are pregnant. We must get these dogs fixed. Time is of the essence, animal control is holding off on seizing and euthanizing these dogs if we can make progress by stopping the breeding, keeping them fed and finding them homes.,Please note we are requiring an application and home checks so we are currently only placing in the Western US.,It is not right for these beautiful animals to be euthanized. Over 30 amazing puppies need a home and if you are considering adopting a pet, this is a great time to reach out a hand in saving a life. ,Currently, feeding approximately 90 dogs to keep them alive costs $200 a day. Your donation goes to feeding these dogs as well as getting them fixed to prevent further breeding amongst their population. We need to get health certifications which a very kind vet specialist has offered to do for all the dogs for $20/each. This certificate of health makes it possible for us to get these little loves placed in homes or sanctuaries. ,It is urgent that we get the funds to complete our goal as soon as possible because this is a very time sensitive issue at hand. Animal control is trying to euthanize all these animals and the sooner we can get them fixed and a health certificate the sooner we can get all these dogs into homes and sanctuaries. ,Any amount helps and is greatly appreciated. As members of a community sometimes it is necessary to come together and clean up the mess of others and at this time these dogs are in dire need of our help. For those who have ever felt that amazing connection with a dog, consider donating to help bring these pups the lives they deserve. ,All proceeds will go directly to pay for the following: 1) food purchases 2) Fixing over 70 adults 3) Health certification for each dog so they may be placed 4) Vet services 5) Transportation 6) other miscellaneous expenses directly related to a rescue effort. No funds will be given directly to the organization we are rescuing these animals from. All fees will be paid directly to vendors and Plan B to Save Wolves is reviewing all expenses and approving payment.,Who we are:  Plan B to Save Wolves is a designated 501c3 overseeing the administration of funds for the project as per the paragraph above (,).

                        ,My name is Samantha, and I recently lost the love of my life, my French Bulldog, Henri.  (Instagram's , ),Henri was my soulmate, my little hero, my inspiration, my constant joy, and my baby boy.,I am raising money to prevent what happened from ever happening again to another fur baby or parent. ,Henri (aka Henri Le Frenchie) died August 2nd, while under the care of the California Veterinary Specialists in Carlsbad, California. I was told by the vet, Dr. Polansky, that Henri died because he had apparently had a stroke and stopped breathing on his own. ,Later I decided to have an autopsy performed by an outside doctor. This doctor informed me that Henri's brain showed no evidence of any stroke and that the cause of his death was pneumothorax from an improperly placed feeding tube that punctured his lung. She said that a hole had been made in Henri's lungs, and that the air had escaped his lungs and filled his chest cavity until his lungs collapsed. She also said there was a procedure that could have rectified this, but the autopsy showed no evidence of it ever being done. She also had a time stamped radiograph showing the feeding tube inside Henri. ,Dr. Polansky had told me that no feeding tube had ever been used. ,Since then I have been told by multiple sources that Dr. Polansky allegedly has a history of making fatal mistakes and lying to the pet parents. And I've been told he allegedly makes those working below him lie as well. ,My heart is beyond shattered. I lost the most precious being in my life. Henri was the sweetest, kindest soul I have ever known. I can't bring Henri back. He is gone forever and my world will never be the same. I will miss him forever. ,I don't ever want this to ever happen to another animal or pet parent again. It shouldn't have happened to Henri. And I wish someone had stood up before I ever took him to that vet. ,I am going to be that person. I am going to stand up. I can't save Henri. But I can try to stop this from happening to future pets and pet parents. I can be the person I wished for, for someone else.,I am asking for your help to raise legal fees. This will be a difficult case against a powerful, multi-location company. Further, under California Law, pets are only regarded as property. I think it is wrong. To me, and I think most people who have loved a pet, pets are family. When pets are seen only as property, it encourages them to be treated as such. It allows them to be hurt without any real consequences. And I want to fight this. Everyone on Instagram encouraged Henri to Fight Like a Frenchie. And he did. So hard. He was such a survivor. But he couldn't fight against having his lung punctured. Now I have to Fight Like a Frenchie Mom.  Nothing will bring Henri back. Nothing will make what happened to him ok. But if I can stop this from happening to others, then I will always regret it if I don't try.,I have been given estimations of legal costs that are staggeringly higher than what I have set as my current goal, but I don't want to discourage people, so it is my starting point. Anything that is not used I will donate to animal charities, including those working to change the laws and have animals elevated above the legal status of ""property."" Henri was not property. He deserved better. All animals deserve better. ,Thank you so much for your help. Please spread the word and share my story. And please hug your fur babies tight. ,With Love,,Samantha, aka Henri's mommy,For more information and pictures of Henri, feel free to visit his Instagram account: , ,I love you, Henri. I will love you forever. ,Thank you for making me the luckiest mommy in the whole world. You will forever be my baby boy.,The final two photos above are a few of my last photos ever taken with Henri. Henri purring in my arms, his wonderful hug, and his precious little face. These photos were taken at the California Veterinary Specialists, where soon after Henri would die.

                        Hello Cats’ Inn family, ,We have some exciting news to share!! With the overwhelming demand, thanks to all of you and your recommendations, we have made the decision to expand into a larger space. We have secured the purrfect building for the new location for The Cats’ Inn – TCI 2.0.   We will be staying in Belmont, across the street, closer to the train station and just a minute from our current facility. We are diligently working on renovations for the new building and expect to move into the new Cats’ Inn sometime later this year – probably in early November, if all goes well with construction. ,We will have many more of the most popular suites available; Villas and Cottages, with lots of windows and sunlight for the kitties to look out from their upgraded suites. We will also have larger, all glass playrooms with many more themes and amenities and climbing activities, including sunbathing hammocks for the kitties to lounge in.  We intend to make it the most amazing cattery the Bay Area has to offer! The new facility will be 3400 sq. ft of pure cat Disneyland heaven!,We also plan be adopting two senior house cats from SPCA or Nine Lives, that would otherwise not find a furrrever home, so they can welcome new and current guests, and have so many more feline and human friends shower them with love and affection ,Unfortunately, though we have hit a hiccup in the budgeting and available funds from the bank - even after all of our very detailed planning, we have been informed by the city of Belmont that we are required to install a new indoor fire sprinkler system for the new facility. Regretfully, this falls way outside our budgeted loan amount (as this was told after we were funded) and the bank is unwilling to grant us a loan extension at this point. We want to create every magnificent detail that we have planned for all of our feline friends and make it an even bigger kitty wonderland than we have now, but this is a show stopper since we cannot open doors without the new sprinkler system.,After trying to re-work, the budget, we have come to the conclusion that we have no other choice but to ask for your help. So, we are humbly asking for your help to supplement the budget needed for the sprinkler system. If you can find it in your heart to donate any amount of $$ to our cause, we would be eternally grateful for your generosity. ,Very warmly,,Your Cats’ Inn Family

                        Copper is a 4 year old Doberman who is a registered service and emotional support dog.  He began limping slightly in Dec 2017. It has recently flared up and there are times he struggles to walk. They believe it is Wobblers disease which affects the spine and discs but the only true way to tell is with an MRI as well as xrays.   He may look like a scary type of dog but he has a heart of gold. We got him when he was just a puppy and he's been blessing our family ever since. My 10 year old son is diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety, ADHD, chronic headache disorder, and had nocturnal seizures as a result of uncontrolled anxiety. When we got Copper we expected nothing more than a pet but he became so much more. In 2016 my son was having issues and seeing specialists trying to figure out fatigue, aches, night terrors, headaches, and incontinence along with uncontrolled Behavior.  He had sleep studies, various medications as well as  testing and diet changes to no avail .  One evening Copper begin barking at the door  almost insisting I go inside his room .  It was then I witnessed my son having a seizure, he was 8 years old and I was terrified .  Nothing had shown up on any of his studies or neurological reports as nocturnal seizures are the hardest to diagnose . It happened again a few weeks later and I was able to catch it on camera to show the neurologist and get my son on the proper medication .  He is completely managed for seizures at this time thanks  to our protector  and faithful companion . My son still suffers severe anxiety as result of continued bullying and ptsd and the dog can sense when an anxiety attack is coming .  Typically he is able to  push his body against my son  almost like a weighted blanket or lay on top of him and relieve the anxiety symptoms .  Due to the crushing diagnosis of possible wobblers disease that affects a significant amount of Dobermans, he is unable to fully do his job . We need an MRI  to determine the best course of treatment for him  but the test is very expensive . I'm a single mom working hard to take care of my children and Copper is my best piece of mind for my son .  I hate asking for help  but my son needs the dog more than I need my pride . If you can see  fit to donate anything it will all be greatly appreciated and go towards the cost of his treatment and MRI. Anything above and beyond what we need will be donated to another organization to help another animal in need .  Thank you for reading our story *we increased our goal due to the cost quoted to us of the MRI ($2800-3200) which does not include therapy.,

                        Sometime in April/May of this year, the thieves came and stole most of our good producing layer chickens (500-600).  This happened quickly, yet so insidiously, we are still in half shock and half denial.,""How could we not have seen this?""  Apparently, we were not the only farm that was targeted, but ""free range"" chickens with no closed gates and padlocks were obviously easy targets for an experienced group of thieves to come in the middle of the night, and grab them 50-100 at a time.  By the time we realized that our egg production was down drastically (systematically in increments of 50-100 eggs), the damage was done.  In all 20 years of raising chickens, this has never happened.  We are used to losing some to eagles or coyotes, but this one, done by humans, was stealthy and lethal.  We talked to one other farmer, whose 200 broilers got stolen right out of his field.  He thinks they come in a group with large garbage cans in a truck, grab them  in a matter of minutes (they are defenseless at night on the perch) and are killed quickly and sold at an underground soup chicken market.  He thinks he even saw a post of his chickens on Craig's list!  The police have a suspect (yes even the name), but so far he is still at large for lack of evidence.  With so many other problems in the area, I  doubt our egg thief is high on their list.,Of course they stole the young ones that just started to lay eggs, which took us 6 months of feed to get to that stage.  My book keeper estimates the loss of revenue through October is anywhere from $35,000 to $45,000 without including what it took to raise them.,This hit us in the busiest hay season, working from dawn to dark, we really didn't have time to re-act, or even feel angry; we just felt defeated and heart broken  Now at the end of August, we are finally slowing down enough to analyze the damage and re-group our chicken program.  The loss was big, and we seriously thought about quitting eggs all together.  Then we thought about all of our customers who came faithfully to buy our eggs and stand in line to do so.  Right. We can't quit.,So here is our plan:  We are moving 2 of our houses closer to our store, building/repairing parameter fences, installing motion sensor lights, putting pad locks on the gates, and looking into installing a security camera system.  We have purchased 500 chicks to replace the stolen ones, which will hopefully begin laying in late October, early November.,It's difficult to come up with funds to rebuild the flock and put in security system when we are already experiencing a large loss of revenue.  So, encouraged by many customers' suggestions, we are asking for some financial assistance to come up with the funds needed to rebuild our flock.  We have never done this, so we really don't know what to expect, but we will be grateful with whatever the amount you can help us with.,Thank you.,Est. Replacement Cost (does not include the actual revenue loss),Chicks (500)                                                       $ 1,400,Feed (until laying-6 months)                    $18,000,Security system                                               $ 1,500,Labor (feeding only)                                      $ 6,000,Total cost until production                     $27,900,Now an Empty chicken house,1 of 2 houses moving closer to the house,Close to houses (dogs).  Now repairing fences, put in fence post for new padlocks, leveling the ground.,What do we need to keep you girls safe??,

We intended to stay there for the long-haul but, after five years, our landlord decided to repurpose the farm for his personal use and that left us with the sudden need to move.,But not just move, we had to find a place to move my family, we had to find a place to move the bookstore, we had to then move my family, and then move the bookstore.  Now, I have a large family and the bookstore was immense.  We had about six months to get this all worked out and accomplished.  However, after a troubled pregnancy, my family welcomed our seventh living child, months earlier than her due date, right in the middle of all this.  My daughter (and her visiting parents) spent months in the NICU at the hospital and finally came home to the farm under very difficult conditions.,I don't know how my family and the bookstore made it through 2017, but by the end of the year, both family and bookstore had moved off the farm and were settling into a new house and a new storefront for the bookstore.,In 2018 my family now lives in a good house in town and, my daughter, is a tiny, but very healthy 15 month-old.,At the new bookstore location, we've gone from welcoming, in a great month at the old location, about 100 visitors to the bookstore, to, in a normal month, welcoming over a thousand visitors. However, the increased sales have not been enough to overcome the financial aftershocks of getting my family and the bookstore through the storms of 2017.,That's why I need your help now.,My debt load, from the move, is now too heavy to pay and I don't see how we can continue to pay the expenses of an open shop without getting a significant amount of that debt load removed.,If you love Loome Theological Booksellers,,if you love independent bookstores,,if you love a space for strangers to meet and discuss God, the great authors, revolutionary ideas, and step back in time through the experience of our rare book collection,,if you love a bookstore that collaborates with local authors and artists to showcase what makes our St. Croix River Valley unique and engaging ,All monies raised will only go towards paying down debt for the bookstore.  If we raise enough money to pay down all the debt, then I will announce new fundraising goals and projects in an update.,Please pray for the work of Loome Theological Booksellers.,I will fight hard to keep this brick and mortar bookstore open here.,It is a good fight.,It is worth it.,

                        ,Back in 2009 when we opened Eagle Rock Brewery, I noticed that the few women who were visiting our tasting room and attending beer events throughout town were often pigeon-holed by their male counterparts into drinking only specific beer styles. And when women asked me (a fellow woman behind the bar) about beer-style recommendations, some men would interject by sharing what they thought women should drink. After seeing this so frequently I felt compelled to create an environment that was less male-dominated than anything else in the beer world. The Women’s Beer Forum was created to serve as an educational platform for more women interested in learning about beer, tasting through different beer styles, and being with a community of other women who enjoy good beer. On occasion, we would have men attend, present, and even participate in the discussions. It was simply named “Women’s Beer Forum” because I wanted to create a comfortable, safe environment for more women to actively join the conversation about craft beer. Most every other beer bar or beer event that I attended had predominantly men in attendance, and I felt there was a true need to balance the gender scale. Thus, the Women’s Beer Forum has been recurring monthly since March 2011. ,In November of 2017, we received an email from an individual who claims to be a men’s rights activist. He reported that he emailed our general email line and was informed by one of our staff that the upcoming Women’s Beer Forum was for ‘women only.’ He then proceeded to demand thousands of dollars from us, while also threatening a discrimination complaint through the government if we refused to pay. Since he had never purchased admission through our online sales portal, we were unaware about his request to attend the Women’s Beer Forum. We apologized about the miscommunication and offered him an opportunity to learn about the same flight of beers provided at the event for the same ticket price. He declined the educational opportunity and instead filed a claim through the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH). After 7 months of waiting for a response, DFEH notified us of their decision that there was reasonable cause to open a case. Our only options: Pay a settlement to him or defend ourselves in a potential lawsuit that they would file on his behalf. ,Looking at this situation from a moral standpoint, our decision seemed easy...We defend what we had worked so hard to create! But another question arose: Were we defending our beloved Eagle Rock Brewery or the Women’s Beer Forum? The sad truth we faced is that while defending ourselves against litigation it would mean risking the very brewery itself.,Career plaintiffs in such cases like these are able to make a living off of filing these types of complaints because most businesses choose to preserve the financial security of the company and pay them off. Career plaintiffs, similar to the “men’s rights activist” we are up against, can make comfortable livings by getting paid out through exploiting loopholes in legislation. All they do is fill out a couple forms per case and wait for checks from their complaints to start rolling in.,It kills me to say that we ended up settling. It’s something we had to do in order to protect the business (Eagle Rock Brewery), our home, the livelihoods of our team, and the investments made by friends and family who believe in us. At this point, we still have to come up with the funds for our legal fees and the settlement amount.,Further, we truly believe that justice hasn’t been achieved and the fight isn’t over. To prevent this from happening again in the future, we are also raising funds to build awareness throughout the beer and small business communities. Our goal is to work on getting legislators to amend the Unruh Act and eliminate the ongoing abuse of this law. As much as we would love to simply put this situation behind us, we very strongly feel there needs to be more awareness about these “men’s rights activists” who target and unfairly take advantage of women’s groups and small businesses. The more people who know about this can protect themselves, their friends, and businesses from such fraudulent claims, the fewer opportunity extortionists have of continuing to make a living off of it!,We are asking for your help. Please consider making a contribution to our campaign, sharing our story, being a unified voice with us, or just stopping by Eagle Rock Brewery to give us a hug or high-five. Thank you all for the support!

                        Help Standing Rock Fight Voter Suppression in North Dakota. ,North Dakota implemented a discriminatory voter ID law targeting Native Americans earlier this month. The District Court found the law had a disproportionate and discriminatory effect on Native voters, yet ultimately the Supreme Court allowed the new rule to take effect.,Now, ND voters can’t use the voter ID they used in the primary because it doesn’t include their now needed current residential address. Native Americans are disproportionately affected because a majority lack residential street addresses on account of their homes on the Reservation having P.O. boxes instead of addresses, by no fault of their own.,“This law clearly discriminates against Native Americans in North Dakota. Our voices should be heard and they should be heard fairly at the polls just like all other Americans,” says Chairman Mike Faith., ,Stand up to those who wish to silence our voices by supporting our movement.

                        L’eau Est La Vie. Mni Mconi. Water Is Life.,Here in the bayous of Louisiana, our water and way of life is under threat, and we need your support.,Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), the very same company behind the notorious Dakota Access Pipeline, is trying to build a 162 mile crude oil pipeline across Louisiana called the Bayou Bridge Pipeline (BBP). ,, crossing an astounding 700 bodies of water including  Bayou LaFourche, a critical reservoir that supplies the United Houma Nation and 300,000 Louisiana residents with clean, safe drinking water.,Existing oil pipelines have already created enormous problems for our crawfishing industry. The BBP will only make these problems worse, creating dams in the Atchafalaya Basin dozens of miles long that irreparably damage the ecosystem and make fishing for crawfish impossible. The crawfishing industry supports thousands of good jobs in Louisiana. The BBP will only create 12 permanent jobs. , When flooding is worse, our communities suffer. Our homes our damaged, our crops are destroyed, our infrastructure is eroded, our families get sick, and our economy is harmed. ,Along its path of destruction, the BBP would impact sacred mounds and threaten drinking water of the United Houma Nation, a tribe that has been seeking federal recognition for decades. The United Houma Nation has not been consulted and has not given consent for the construction of this pipeline.,Wetlands are sponges for floodwaters. They are vital to a resilient Southern Louisiana, and already because of climate change and development, Louisiana is losing an average of one acre of coastal wetlands per hour. The State of Luisiana is frantically trying to figure out how to save our coast, but building the BBP will make the situation worse. , It will create the carbon equivalent of 30 new coal plants. The BBP is not compatible with our global mandate to limit climate change to 1.5℃. ,Our growing network of impacted landowners, tribal members, environmental justice communities, and fisherfolk have submitted comments, spoken out at hearings, and demanded proper environmental reviews and that our concerns will be taken seriously. None of this has happened. ETP has swindled landowners, bought our politicians, and refused to address any of the community’s needs. Enough is enough. If our leaders won’t stand up to stop this pipeline and protect our water, then we the people of Louisiana will. ,We have built the L’eau Est La Vie camp to protect our water and our way of life from the Bayou Bridge pipeline. ,We need your support to acquire crucial supplies including:,- Building materials,- Tools,- Medical supplies,- Boats,- Tents,- Mosquito protection,- Sleeping bags,- Food,- Cooking supplies,- Clothing ,- Action materials,- Art supplies,- Documentation equipment,- Safety equipment,We are also raising funds anticipating needs for legal aid, trainings, and more.,Please give generously and share with your community.

                        ,Lake Nacimiento, known as “The Dragon” because of its distinctive shape, is in extreme peril and needs your help. Millions of gallons of water are being taken out of the lake each day by Monterey County and sent north, primarily for the benefit of its farmers in the Salinas Valley, but also to support a fish habitat and to sell on the open market for profit. This isn’t simply “Water Over The Dam,” it is the moral equivalent of draining the life’s blood of The Dragon. Left unchecked, this massive release of water will devastate the local economy in San Luis Obispo County, where the lake is actually located, by curtailing recreation, depressing property values and reducing business and tax revenues. Although the farmers in the Salinas Valley are entitled to a fair share of the water, they are not entitled to ALL of it. There is no way of even knowing just how much water the farmers are getting, since much of it goes underground where it cannot be measured. It is also impossible to determine how much water, if any, is being wasted since that also defies measurement. What is clear is that ever since the time it completed a “divisionary facility” in Salinas, Monterey County has steadily increased the water it releases over the dam on a daily basis. See: ,  ,Nacimiento Reservoir was originally designed and built by Monterey County for irrigation, flood control, groundwater recharge, and recreation. It was completed in 1957. Although the lake formed by the reservoir is entirely inside the geographical boundaries of San Luis Obispo County, the water is controlled by Monterey County under an operating license issued by the State of California. Over time, Monterey County has demonstrated that it does not care about the recreational aspect of its management of the lake, despite that component being of equal value to the others. Monterey County’s current attitude towards recreation at Lake Nacimiento borders on contempt.,The Nacimiento Regional Water Management Advisory Committee (“NRWMAC”) was formed in the late1980’s to represent Lake Nacimiento property owners, visitors and enthusiasts in dealing with Monterey County’s management of this precious resource. During its tenure, NRWMAC has fought to maintain a consistent and appropriate water level of 748 feet above mean sea level (msl). At this level, during most years, there is enough water to satisfy the needs of the farmers, meet the California Department of Fish and Wildlife requirements for the fish habitat and concurrently sustain recreation throughout the peak summer months – at least through Labor Day of each year. For the most part, NRWMAC has been successful in its attempt to maintain a mutually acceptable lake level. Lately, however, Monterey County has been promulgating the notion that a lake level of 730 feet msl will sustain recreation. This is absolutely not true. At that level, launch ramps and docks along the lake become unusable, and previously submerged rocks, tree stumps and islands start surfacing, posing hazards to boating.,NRWMAC has tried to negotiate a reasonable compromise with Monterey County over the lake level. Monterey County, however, will not negotiate. NRWMAC drafted and circulated a petition demanding a reduction to the massive and unreasonable daily water releases. This petition garnered over 6,000 signatures, and was presented to Monterey County in May of this year. Monterey County dismissed the petition, labeling it “factually inaccurate,” although it failed to explain how it was inaccurate. NRWMAC Directors have been on radio and television, and in print media, appealing for restraint over the water releases, but these effort have had no effect: Monterey County continues to drain the lake at its sole and unbridled discretion. Finally, as a last resort, and responding to the entreaties of its constituents, NRWMAC has been forced to retain a law firm experienced in water rights, and a team of hydrologists, to seek a legal remedy to halt the excessive outflow of water.,NRWMAC has exhausted nearly its entire operating budget by subsidizing the legal fees to date and now it needs your help. NRWMAC has started a GoFundMe campaign to replenish the funds necessary to sustain its legal challenge. It is estimated that a minimum of $100,000.00 is required to continue forward and resolve this issue. Please contribute whatever you can to help NRWMAC Save the Dragon, and please forward this email and this GoFundMe link to everyone on your mailing list.,NRWMAC is a non-profit organization. Because of the way it is structured, donations made to it, or to the legal fund it is sponsoring, are not tax deductible to the donor.

                        ,This team, headed up by veteran Cannonball rider Norm Nelson, has been one of the most successful teams in the history of the event. This year Norm will ride his 1911 Reading Standard 3400 miles across America, from Portland Maine to Portland Oregon. The historic ride will take 15 days, with a rest stop in famous Sturgis, South Dakota. ,It takes a tremendous amount of planning, building, testing and funding to prepare the motorcycle, rider and support team for this extremely challenging event. Norm will ride his 107 year-old, 6 horsepower, single speed bike from coast to coast using his extensive experience, skills and determination in a competition with motorcycles from all over the world. While the ride is complex, the goal is simple. Norm is planning to win. ,With a top speed of about 48 miles per hour and fuel capacity of just 2 gallons of gas, riding the 230-pound Reading Standard in the Cannonball is a difficult assignment. With three previous Cannonball Runs under his belt, however, Norm is more than up to the task. ,Norm has assembled a stellar road team to support his efforts. Jack and Sheila Wright from Conyers, Georgia will serve as support vehicle drivers and technicians. Chief Technician is Walt Brown of Jacksonville, recently retired from a career with Mercedes-Benz. ,Behind the scenes are Steve Pennington of Ormond Beach, an outstanding fabricator, machinist and technician who was key in preparing the motorcycle for the Cannonball. Billy Lane, Ken Porter, Joe Gimpel and Jason Sims have all been involved in the extensive machining and fabrication operations to prepare the Reading Standard for the difficult competition. All are from the greater Daytona Beach area and are unmatched in their talents and expertise. ,Reporting on the daily progress of Norm’s ride will be Rob Goetz. An experienced Cannonball reporter. Rob’s updates are as entertaining as they are informative. All team members will receive his email reports each day of the Cannonball. ,The team will only be complete, however, when you join us. Although there are numerous volunteers already on the team, there are still extensive expenses involved in this complex undertaking. ,It costs about $20,000 to compete in the Cannonball, and I am asking my friends and supporters to contribute toward that amount by joining us on Team RS., - You will receive daily email updates during the Cannonball., - Updates plus a custom Team RS cap., - Updates, cap and custom Team RS T-shirt., - Updates, cap, T-shirt and embroidered Team RS polo shirt.,Whatever you can give to support Team RS and our Cannonball Run is very much appreciated.

When not in use, it zips up and can stay on back of seat or slide under.  It was developed so that kids that have to drive long distances in the car for sports or school can still have a delicious homemade meal, but without the mess.  The Tupperware fits in the openings and it contains all the crumbs.  A great invention for both kids and parents.  ,Our group will have 4 inventions represented at the National Competition.,Costs to attend the conference for each child and one parent per child will be:,1) Registration fee for inventor is $300,2) Registration fee is $350 for guardian/parent. ,3) Lodging is $148 per night * 3 nights ($450.00),The total is approximately 1,100.00 per child to attend.  We really want to have this opportunity to go and compete Nationally.  We would be so grateful if you would help us realize our dream!  ,Thanks so much:,Haylee, Joe Ariel, Sasha, Summer, Leo, Elias, and Elvin

One of ultra distance cycling remote on road races that challenges the hardiest of riders, then the Trans America Bike Race, a 6,800km ultra across North America. The biggest of the three races and incredible tough in itself! Then there is the Trans Continental! The shortest of the three but the one with all of the climbing! More climbing per km than any other ultra! 

The food bill alone per race is estimated at around AUD $4-5K plus air fares, parts, components and the rest! Can you help Rhino number the first person to take the Triple Crown?!! Most of this has been paid for but I am looking for approx $5k to finish off the transam and take on the TCR! 

If you have enjoyed the past two years of entertainment and adventures through Instagram following me then I hope you can help get me across the finish line and get that coveted triple crown! 

Thanks a bunch you cracking cucumbers!!

                        ROE V. WADE is the untold story of how people lied, how the media lied, and how the courts were manipulated to pass a law that has since killed over 60 Million Americans.,We are half way through production, and raising additional funds to get the movie into theaters this fall!,Supreme Court Justice Kennedy has announced his retirement and our movie could have influence on who is picked as the new Justice. This could overturn the decision on Roe v. Wade which can save the lives of millions., ,Here is a still from production below of the US Supreme Court Set. Help us release this movie by the fall while the senate confirms a new Supreme Court Justice!,￼￼￼,Many documentaries have been made, but no one has had the courage to make an actual feature film, a theatrical movie about the true story. Roe v. Wade stars:,As Supreme Court Justices:,JON VOIGHT, CORBIN BERNSEN, ROBERT DAVI, WILLIAM FORSYTHE, STEVE GUTTENBERG, WADE WILLIAMS, & RICHARD PORTNOW.,&,JAMIE KENNEDY, STACEY DASH, JOEY LAWRENCE & GREER GRAMMER.,This is the most important movie to be made in our generation.,“Designed to inspire the viewer to engage in the movement to restore respect for human life.” Cardinal Burke,This campaign is for the most important pro-life movie in history. This will be the first movie ever about the true story of ROE v. WADE, the most famous court case in America that legalized Abortion. We need your help to fight for the lives of the unborn, because Hollywood refuses to.,Hollywood only wants you to hear their version of the story – in fact, there are 3 movies currently in development that take a pro-abortion stance. But you shouldn’t be surprised. Hollywood has always had an agenda to influence Americans to accept abortion, even if they have to re-write history to do it.,***********************************************,FACEBOOK BANS SHARES,We need your support now more than ever. Facebook has banned us from inviting friends to “Like” our page and from “Sharing” our PAID ads. Breitbart even published an article on our campaign.,Check the article out here:, ,…,Thank you for your continued support!,WHO WE ARE:,The Team:,Directed & Produced by Cathy Allyn & Nick Loeb,Executive Producer: Dr. Alveda King,Co-Producer: Mindy Robinson,**** Dr. Alveda King will also be making a cameo in the film as Dr. Mildred Jefferson’s Mother!!!,This is the true untold story of ROE v. WADE:,We open the movie with the story of how it all began. It all started with a woman named Margaret Sanger. She was the founder of Planned Parenthood. Her initiative was called the Negro project, and as she gives a speech in the movie at a KKK rally, she describes her intentions to reduce the growth of African American population in our country.,In the movie, Dr. Bernard Nathanson, the most famous abortionist of those times, then joins the cause.,They all then recruit feminist Betty Friedan to join their team.,Bernard and Betty, along with the team at Planned Parenthood, search the country to find a pregnant girl they can use to sue the government for her right to have an abortion.,Our characters find the perfect pawn: a broke girl with a 10th grade education named Norma McCorvey. She is now famously known as “Jane Roe.” They all convince Norma that she can have an abortion if she sues, knowing full well that her case will never get to the courts in time.,Our characters succeed, and we watch on as Norma sues Henry Wade, the district attorney of Dallas County. Roe v. Wade is born.,Now that they finally had it in the courts, they had to get the Justices to vote their way, so they fed fake polls and fake statistics to the media.,This is when Bernard and Betty with Planned Parenthood even brought Hollywood on board getting them to do TV shows and movies about abortion.,This was all done to influence public opinion and manipulate the courts.,But there were a few people willing to step up to fight them. This fight is led by the film’s protagonist Mildred Jefferson, the first African American woman to graduate from Harvard Medical School. She believed that she became a doctor to protect life, not destroy it. Not only was she trying to save lives, she was trying to save her race.,She joined the Catholics, other men, and other women, to try to educate Americans on the truth, but they were up against the most well-funded revolution in 20th century America.,Mildred and her team marched, held up signs, got the police to raid illegal abortion clinics, adopted the unborn and most importantly, prayed to God for help.,Although they did everything they could possible do, the ban on abortion was overturned.,What most people don’t know is that the very people who spent their lives fighting to legalize abortion, were faced with the harsh consequences soon after. At the end of the movie Bernard through the help of new sonogram technology, realizes he is killing babies, confesses to all the lies and becomes a leading activist in the pro life movement. Even Norma, our Jane Roe, realizes she was manipulated and becomes a leading activist to protect life.,Our movie will not only shed a light on that truth but will also change hearts and minds. We have distribution on 1000 screens so even if just one person changes as a result of this movie, we will have saved a life.,Please pledge now, and share this campaign with your friends so we can bring ROE v. WADE to life.

                        ,We set a goal, and you surpassed it! We are deeply grateful for—and elated over—your donations to The People’s Mayor: Ed Lee, a film-in-progress co-produced by the Chinese Historical Society of America (CHSA) and Bay Area Emmy winner Rick Quan. When we launched the endeavor in June, we hoped for $50,000 to make a documentary about Ed Lee, son of working-class immigrants, San Francisco Chinatown lawyer, champion of civil rights and equal opportunity and the first Chinese American mayor of a major US city. We hit that mark within a couple of months, and your enthusiastic generosity is enabling the film project to rise from good to great.,The tremendous response to the GoFundMe drive shows “how much love and support [Lee] has in the community, especially the Asian American community,” Quan said. “There’s so much interest because Mayor Lee touched so many people.”,Lee died on Dec. 12, 2017, after a heart attack. He was 65.,The film will contain stories and reflections from Lee’s wife, mother and other family members, childhood pals, former mayor Willie Brown, Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry, former Washington governor and U.S. ambassador to China Gary Locke, colleagues from the Asian Law Caucus and City Hall, a college professor of Lee’s and Salesforce founder Marc Benioff, among others.,To date, the donations total more than $81,000, and there’s a lot of work ahead, such as shooting, graphic design, editing and other post-production tasks, publicity and distribution. Contributions already made and still coming in will help ensure that this hour-long film is inspiring, impactful and widely seen. We all want as many people as possible to know about Lee’s life, character and principles.,Please view and share the latest trailer , and stay tuned for the film’s premiere in the late fall.,Should you need an Ed Lee fix in the meantime, City Hall’s South Light Court has on display photos, golf balls, a putter, letters, a flaming orange SF Giants jacket and other items from and about him. CHSA collaborated on the exhibit, which is open through the end of 2018.,Thank you again for your support!,Last December, the city of San Francisco lost its beloved mayor, Ed Lee, unexpectedly and far too soon.,The Chinese Historical Society of America (CHSA) will present the inspirational story of this remarkable man. The film will chronicle, document, and preserve the memory of Ed Lee for future generations the life and character of the seemingly ordinary man who grew up in Seattle’s public housing and became the first Chinese American mayor of a major city.,Ed Lee was a lawyer-activist for tenants and garment workers, a habitual punster, a self-sacrificing civil servant, a reluctant-turned-enthusiastic mayor, a consensus builder, and a San Francisco Giants, 49ers, and Golden State Warriors super-fan.,CHSA is partnering with Bay Area television producer and Emmy-winner Rick Quan to produce the hour-long documentary. The project has the blessing and active support of Mayor Lee’s family, to whom he was very devoted.,The Chinese Historical Society of America (CHSA) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit and the oldest organization in the country dedicated to the preservation of the history and contributions of Chinese-Americans in the United States.  ,The film, with the working title “Ed Lee: The People’s Mayor,” is projected to be completed in the fall of 2018. ,Please help us capture Ed’s inspirational lessons onto film for our future generations by making your generous donation today. Donations are needed for ongoing filming and editing, plus publicity and distribution. Our goal is to raise a minimum of $50,000 to fund this significant and meaningful project.,We greatly appreciate contributions of any amount. Please donate online today using GoFundMe. ,Donations are tax-deductible.,We also accept checks, payable to CHSA, mailed to the following address:,CHSA,965 Clay Street,San Francisco, CA 94108,Please donate today and share this link with your family and friends: ,

This is where I built the first ever flamethrowers and robots used at Burning Man in the '90's. I hosted music, noise and art events with the likes of the Bicycle Rodeo, Mitch Altman, Matt Heckert of Survival Research Laboratories, Heather Dewey-Hagborg to name a few and exhibitions with and for many many other artists and art groups (more below). , ,- Move out: debris boxes, rental truck, labor, hauling $20K ,- Permanent storage: a barn or a shipping container and/or a space to park it in the Greater Bay Area (another payment in kind opportunity!) $10K for cost of container(s) and trucking,- Lawyers fees: $10K (and up),With another $10K I can breathe a sigh of relief as far as paying MORE lawyers (ugh), more moving & hauling costs, outfitting new workspace, overhead for long term  storage (some robots are BIG), and  preparing for upcoming exhibits in the Fall of 2018 and all of 2019 (some of the best opportunities of my career).,I'm asking for $20K (or more) though really $50K is the minimum to keep going.  ,In-kind payments from friends already: a temporary workshop, temporary storage  (thank you Matt Heckert and Charlie Gadeken) for some of my work  and referrals to a tenant's rights lawyer (thanks to Ragi Dindial for his legal guidance and support).,And I sort of have a live space. ,I ran my studio as an experimental art/live space that housed and supported over 100 other artists and activists. All with NO grants, no outside support, no gallery sales and no renting to tech businesses. In 1995 when I moved in the street was dirt and littered with abandoned cars and homeless everywhere, prostitution rings and the truly disturbed and disadvantaged lurking to rob you.  ,It was the project that should have never worked: an artist supporting artists by sharing below market rent. ,Yet the 25 year run of people, events, exhibits are a testament to art over commerce. ,Now, like virtually all other artists in San Francisco, I'm getting evicted.  ,I will keep making art. I will keep supporting others who make art and are active for change. ,Sincere thanks from the bottom of my heart for any support you can offer. ,It has been a gift to share my space with so many amazing people. I’m looking ahead to how I can keep doing this for the next 25 years. ,
,Rented way back in 1995, my space is was one of the last remaining raw warehouse art spaces and I made it into a home for experimental, non commercial art. I hosted jaw-dropping, fire spewing, ear shattering robot performances, music, noise and art events with the likes of Chris Johanson, Johanna Jackson, Marie Lornez and her epic boat, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, Matt Heckert. ,I held numerous events like a mayoral fundraiser for the Green Party, art exhibits, housed visiting artists, when countless friends were getting evicted during the first dot-com I supported multiple people in distress, supported homeless folks giving food, sustenance, supplies and more,  writers, dancers, painters and activists; provided emergency art storage and live / work studios way way under market rates. ,I did all this without grants or outside support.,No trust funds, patrons or high paying side jobs here. I passed along the cheap rent. ,I provided housing and studios for countless artists, freaks, traveling activists and radical journalists like Trevor Paglen, AC Thompson, Heather Dewey-Hagborg, worked on Survival Research Laboratories shows, and countless others. ,My life and warehouse were the inspiration for Rudy Rucker’s sci-fi novel ,.  Another book that wouldn't have happened without my warehouse is ,., ,As seen on the ,  this past year, I built some 16’ tall mind-reading Robots with Mitch Altman,OMG I was in the ,  !

I'm on year 38 as an artist. ,I'm working to make everything fall into place to keep momentum for the next couple of years---some of the most important in my life.,A main concern is my old, tired body. Formerly broken fingers and limbs - my art wounds- flare up now and then. One is nothing without their health. ,Sorting through and moving 25 years of equipment and materials on my own is a major challenge.,There's always a risk with a renter's lawsuit. It could lose and if it does it's possible I could be sued for a lot more than I have ever made or will ever make in the rest of my life. Much more than I'm asking for right now. ,From my activist work, organizing marches, prop making and self survival and safety in violent confrontations with power, to traveling the world showing and making art, in India, Africa, all over the U.S. and Europe the 25 years in this space have been spectacular, as an artist,  not going to stop, ever, this I know. The challenge is to keep that momentum moving forward at this stressful and critical juncture.,——————,Karl Marx was right, Capitalism doesn't work without gaming private property!,I never gamed this art space, never rented to tech bros or overcharged tenants. Some said I was a fool, I just did what I hoped someone would do for me.,--------------,

,This year at NAWIC, we have put the focus on how we can ""Make A Measurable Difference.""

Gary was framed for murder in Louisiana when he was 16, sentenced to death and given an execution date of May 1,1976. His case was internationally known. Gary spent 41 1/2 years in Angola prison Louisiana  and was released in April 2016. He was an innocent teenager and spent decades in a notorious prison.,We ask for any donation. However, for those donating $60 or more, you will be invited to Gary Tyler's birthday celebration in Santa Monica on Sunday  July 15, with THE CHAMBERS BROTHERS. (That's $1.50 per year that Gary was incarcerated),As a teenager on death row Gary was never able to develop a work history. Thus, unlike the rest of us, he was released without a penny in social security and must work until he is 69 to even qualify for the minimum.  We feel it is our duty to provide some financial support for Gary as he reenters society. In the two years since release he has begun the process of reentry, and that includes the simplest things like shopping in a store, learning how to drive, getting a drivers license,,He has been working with homeless youth at SPY in Venice California. In addition he has been a powerful community speaker on issues of ending the death penalties and the problems of mass incarceration. he has spoken at USC (5 times), UCLA, CSUN, CSU Long Beach, UC Irvine, Loyola Law School, Loyola Marymount, New West Charter High School, Tim Robbins Actors Gang (2X), Jackson Browne's Prop 62 Concert, All Saints Episcopal Church, Hastings Law School and many other venues.

As we speak they're are brothers and sisters who not only have no food, but also no bibles or proper housing in their places of worship. Just like in the Torah when Joseph was sold in slavery, our families were also sold but when the famine came Joseph  was put in a position to able to provide food and save his family Israel. We in the west have the same opportunity our ancestors did  as the descendants of slaves sold into Spiritual Egypt by our brothers. But now have to chance to bring Shalom to the entire family of Israel.Funds from Operation Joseph will go directly to Hebrew communities and assemblies through West Africa to buy food and supplies and bibles for those in need.

                        David Grant Voeller went to be with the Lord on September 25th, 2018. The legacy and memories he made in the 33 years of life shared with friends and family, will never be forgotten. He was a man who's life reflected Christ's love. He never turned a blind eye to those in need and was always generous with whatever resource he had. David had a love for adventure, the great outdoors, and flying the open skies. He was a family man, a lawyer, a pilot, and a hunter. First and foremost, a family man. David leaves behind his wife of 10 years, Jackie, and their four beautiful children: Robert 9, Megan 6, David Grant 4, and Katie Grace 2. David is the man we all strive to be like in life. He was loving, had a great sense of humor, was patient, kind, and humble. ,The purpose of this fund is to help Jackie continue David’s legacy within the community.,""The LORD himself goes before you and will be with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged."" - Deuteronomy 31:8,

                        For the past twenty years, Karyn and I have been praying for the opportunity to welcome an adopted child into our lives, to participate with Christ in his reign and rule by placing a fatherless child in our family, and to bear witness to his kingdom in all the ways that only adoption can. ,A few days ago, we received the call from our Bethany Christian Services case worker that a birth mom in Raleigh has chosen our family to adopt her baby girl ... and she's due before the end of the month!,The call came a week after Karyn and I had a painful discussion about the process, one that left us sincerely wondering if our season for adopting was over. Following that conversation, we both made a decision to entrust (yet again and still) the outcome to the Lord. That prayer had two parts to it. First, to renew our availability to Him and his purposes. And second, to communicate our willingness to let go of our dream if it really isn't his will for us. ,Then the phone call came. ""A young, African-American woman has looked through all of our profile books and has chosen , family. If you are still willing to adopt, then I believe this little girl is the one."",Karyn and I were practically speechless. Is this really happening? Is this call really different from all of the other calls we've received, all of the other children we were asked to consider only to have the birth mom or the agency choose another family? Should we let our hearts get excited again? Are we up for risking it one more time? Are our other children ready? Are , ready?     ,All of those questions -- with all of their accompanying doubts and fears -- faded away immediately as we returned to our original prayer: ""Here we are, Lord, send us."" ,And so, here we are. ,Here we are saying yes to this opportunity. Here we are saying yes to this next adventure of faith. Here we are saying yes to adding a brand new baby girl , to our family. And here we are saying, ""Yes, we most certainly need your help."" ,Therefore, would you prayerfully consider partnering with us to make our twenty-year prayer a reality? The nature of this process has kept us from asking for your help sooner; specifically, we haven't wanted to seek support for an adoption that we weren't sure was going to happen. As a result, time is of the essence, and we need to present Bethany Christian Services with a check for $21,500 the day we bring our sixth child and our third daughter home -- seven days after she is born. ,Words cannot express what your investment will mean to Karyn, Quinn, Xander, Kayne, Kore, Kai, and me; to the incredibly courageous birth mom; and ultimately to the newest member of the Wallace Family. We do trust, however, that if you are still reading this story then you have a really good idea how grateful we are.,May the Lord bless you abundantly for your generosity and faithfulness. And may his kingdom come and his will be done on earth as it is in heaven.,Yours,,Kyle+

I want to coach people in emotional health and help them discover their belovedness and true identity in Jesus Christ so they move through our Washington knowing who they are and whose they are. I want to help people to operate from a place of favor with God.

Something unique for DC and the people who move here to change the world. Something that will help people THRIVE and not just survive till Saturday.  Something that will advance the kingdom of heaven and expand the loving family of God in the nation's capital.  ,My aim is to do ministry school recon in California so I can observe best practices and make informed decisions on how to best pursue these goals for our city.   Help me help DC!

                        Dear Friends,,A few short days ago, within a matter of hours, a family was ripped apart by the loss of their young, devoted and loving mother. Hindi was a magnificent soul, who was torn from her family due to a sudden illness at the young age of 32. Her passing has created an indescribable void amongst her family, friends, colleagues and community. ,Hindi was a hard working and passionate educator, whose ambition led her to accomplish a tremendous amount in her tragically short life. She lived and breathed education, creating bonds with her students that will be everlasting. At the same time, Hindi was an incredible homemaker and devoted mother to her 5 children. Tragically, 8 year old triplets Eliana, Hudi and Ezra, 4 year old Dorit, and her youngest, Abie, a mere baby of 18 months old, are left to grow up without their beloved mother. ,It is hard to believe that someone so full of life is no longer with us. Her passion and wit has been passed on to her children, who are energetic, creative, brilliant and in desperate need of our help right now. Dovid, the love of her life and true partner is now raising their five beautiful children.,The family is endlessly grateful for all those from around the world who have reached out with the concern of their well being during this terribly dark time. ,A fund has been set up to raise $1 million to help the family, as Dovid must now support his family as well as care for his five young children. Funds raised will go directly to providing household help and basic necessities for the family's immediate needs, as well as help provide for the children's future.,All donations will be tax-deductible through Beis Gimple Chaim Shul / The Nemes Hall. Rabbi Yosef S. Greenwald is the CEO of SGM Socher Inc. and Rabbi of the Beis Gimpel Chaim Shul. He is a relative of the Krinksy/Kanarfogel family and trusted by them to withdraw and transfer all donation funds. ,An oversight committee has been assembled to be responsible for all funds raised during this campaign. A wealth manager is being hired to manage and allocate the funds appropriately.,Oversight Committee:,Rabbi Moshe Pinson,Yoni Raskin,Rabbi Moshe Greenwald,Rabbi Zalman Wolowick,Yali Margalit

                        On May 26, 2018, a jury trial was held in Federal Court in St. Lucie County, Florida. The jury awarded Hill's Estate $4 ($1 for each child's pain and suffering and $1 for funeral expenses) and found him 99% at fault, reducing the total verdict to 4 cents. It will be appealed.,This gofundme is designed to pick up where the jury left off and provide for Hill's children, repair of the home and serve to make sure justice can be obtained.,On January 14, 2014, a St. Lucie County Sheriff's Office deputy shot and killed Gregory Hill through his closed garage door after responding to a loud music complaint. Gregory Hill was in his garage listening to Drake's song 'All Me' when police responded. Police spent 60 seconds on Hill's property, banged violently on his garage door with an asp, leaving dents on it, and then claimed Hill was an aggressor when he simply opened (and then quickly closed) his garage door. Police shot 4 times, striking Hill 3 times.,Police claimed Hill had a gun in his hand as the garage door went up and down. Hill's own daughter attended school across the street and watched as her father was shot and killed. She and several school witnesses saw no gun in his hand. An unloaded gun was found in Hill's back pocket. That gun was free of any blood or brain splatter or material DNA. The location of Hill's wounds discredit any theory of holding a gun where it was identified. Forensic testimony also revealed Hill was incapable of putting that gun back in his pocket after being shot in the head.,The shooting officer claimed he screamed, ""Sheriff's Office. Gun, gun, put down the gun,"" three to four times before firing. Tests revealed this would have taken well in excess of 9 to 10 seconds, far more than the 3 seconds one officer testified was the total time the door went up and down. Further, neither officer heard the other yell a single word except, ""hey."" Witnesses across the street heard the officers banging on the door, but never heard a single command.,Despite these facts, the jury deliberated for 10 hours. After once saying they couldn't reach a verdict, they reached a verdict. They awarded $1 to each of Hill's three children and $1 for funeral expenses. They found Hill 99% responsible for his own death. As such, the total verdict was $.04 cents, which was reduced to $0.,Gregory Hill was raised in the same house where he was shot and killed. And he was raising his children in the same family home. The home was also destroyed as police shoot chemical agent through nearly every window of the home, falsely claiming Hill was alive and ""barricaded"" inside. Memories were destroyed, toys were contaminated and even some of the keepsakes for his upcoming wedding were poisoned by police attempting to poison a man they had already killed.,The family attorney, John Phillips, will place any and all funds in an account, reserved for the children of Greg Hill and ensure that the funds are protected, that the family home is repaired or restored and that the children's needs are taken care of. Should they be necessary, some funds may be reserved for the court costs in this matter. A full accounting will be provided to the family and the family and legal team are working together to have a full plan for the best distribution of all funds.,Please help this family. Tell this story. Pray for peace and justice.,

                        I am a law professor and international children's rights scholar and advocate who has been volunteering with the team of attorneys  interviewing children and the families at the border under the Flores agreement. The team is being led by Peter Schey of the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law. In light of the recent crisis, the Flores team needs many more attorneys, interpreters, child therapists, and other professionals to volunteer to meet with children who have been separated from their families in all of the locations where they are being held. I have heard from a number of people who are willing to volunteer to interview these children, but do not have the funds. I have also been hearing from people who cannot go, but would like to help pay for others to do so. Thus, I am setting up this campaign in my individual capacity to match sponsors and volunteers so that we have enough money for every separated child to be interviewed and documented so we know who they are, where they are, who their parents are, and can prepare declarations that can be submitted to the court in Flores. One hundred percent of these funds (after GoFundMe and credit card fees) will go to funding direct modest travel costs for volunteers. If any funds remain once this crisis ends, they will be donated to the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, which is the organization responsible for ensuring the enforcement of the settlement terms under Flores.  If you have any questions or would like more information or would like to be matched with a specific volunteer or volunteers, please feel free to contact me directly. Otherwise, thank you for trying to help these children in whatever way you are able.

                        As of August 11th 2018, Yasmin Morup and Connor Rideout will be going to Red Lodge, Montana to be bound in wedlock. We have both decided that home is in Toronto, Canada, and with Yasmin not being from Canada, it makes this process come with a plethora of fees, including very expensive lawyer and government processing costs. So instead of asking for material gifts at the wedding, which we could not take home with us to Toronto anyways, we are asking for a donation of any kind to this page. ,The only gift Yasmin and myself could ask for is keeping our physical  separation come the end of the summer, as short as possible. I will be having to go back to our home in Toronto to return to school this fall and the goal is to have Yazzy there with me making movies, in under 6 months. The sooner we have the money to pay for all of the immigration expenses, the sooner we can send our paperwork in to get processed, meaning the less time we have to spend away from eachother. ,Any and all donations mean so much to us and are greatly appreciated!

                        ,Meet Pratima Sherpa:,(Photo Credit: Vladimir Weinstein),Pratima is 18 years old. She lives (and was born) in a shed on the 4th hole of Royal Nepal Golf Club. And she is the #1 Female Golfer in Nepal.,My team and I were introduced to Pratima in Kathmandu, Nepal in May of 2016, while I was writing a LINKS Magazine article on golf in Nepal. I was with my photographer, Vladimir Weinstein, and producer Miles Ashton. All the members that we met said the same thing, “You need to meet Pratima.” We did. And I’m so glad we did. I caddied for Pratima as she played at Royal Nepal Golf Club, and did interviews with her over several days. We visited her family in their shed. Petted her dogs. Helped wrangle her goats. Watched Pratima compete in the Pepsi Open at Royal Nepal (of the nine tournaments in which Pratima has competed this year, she has won seven). I wrote a feature article on Pratima for Golf Digest's November 2016 Issue, which can be viewed here:  ,Pratima's parents work on the golf course at Royal Nepal. The shed that they live in is not theirs. Each day, Pratima works towards her dream: to become the first ever female golf professional in Nepal. And we want to help.,Here’s what we’re going to do:,The donations that we receive in this initial GoFundMe campaign will go to a Team Pratima Fund –– overseen by myself, Miles, Vladimir, Pratima's host-mother from this past summer Tanya Smith-Montano, and Pratima's host-sister Sophia Montano –– with one goal: Help Pratima become the first ever female golf professional in Nepal. This initial fundraising drive will support the following items:,-Golf Clubs,-Golf Balls,-Swing Coaching,-Gym membership for strength training,-Tournament Entry Fees,-Travel to tournaments outside Kathmandu ,-Data Plan for N-Cell (Nepal’s cellphone service, for Pratima’s phone).,-Water purifying Steripen (to purify tap water at Royal Nepal Golf Club).,This is the start.,If Pratima succeeds in her dream, and becomes Nepal's first ever female golf professional, she will inspire young girls throughout Nepal. ,Please join Team Pratima. Let's help make her dream come true.

                        If you had just one conversation with Ramiro, or hundreds, his warm personality made you an instant fan of this young man whom we lost far too soon.,Ramiro Calixto influenced many lives and became a real presence in the youth sports community in Chicago.  If your family or team spent time at Bradley Sports Center, you undoubtedly knew Ramiro as the welcoming smile at the front desk, the professional who would do anything to serve his guests, the friend to so many young players, and the huge fan of the game that so many of us love.  He made sure that, when families were at the BSC, they felt welcome and safe.  Ramiro fostered an atmosphere in which every kid was having fun and was becoming the best they could possibly be -- at whatever they were doing., For those of us who have had the honor of sharing his contagious smile, we are without words to describe the void that is now present.,Ramiro poured his heart and soul into the people he engaged with, and he loved baseball – whether watching it, playing it, or teaching it.  The baseball community in Chicago was a better place for the fact that Ramiro was a part of it.  As a baseball community, we are now rallying his/our baseball network to help his family in their time of need and as a way to honor him as we all say good-bye.,Ramiro had a vision to offer financial assistance to any baseball or softball organizations, teams or players who desired access to high level training and practice facilities but could not take advantage of such facilities because of the costs associated.  He was adamant that all players should have opportunities, and he sought to find a way to make this possible.   Ramiro was weeks away from launching his own campaign to pursue funding for such individuals and teams – thus helping them eliminate impediments to becoming as good as they could be.  ,Any funds raised will be directed, in Ramiro’s name, to help support baseball and softball programs, teams and players in need around the city.  It is our hope that this fund will be the starting point for the realization of Ramiro’s dream of helping all players become as good as they possibly can be.  Such a legacy would not only ensure that Ramiro is recognized for the indelible impact he had on so many young athletes, but would also ensure that his love of the game and his love of people live on for many years to come.      ,If you have questions or are interested in becoming involved, please contact:,Sean Delanty with Bradley Sports Center  ,Jim Petitpren with Hamlin Park Baseball

                        We are Texas Crew,We are the University of Texas at Austin student-run club rowing team. We row on Lady Bird Lake in Austin, TX six days of the week at 5:15 in the morning. We strive to promote athletic excellence within our school and to promote the sport of rowing in our community. Every year our student athletes outperform themselves both on and off the water, balancing their dedication to the team with their studies in college.,What Happened?,Our boats were in transit to Oklahoma City for the Stars and Stripes Regatta on June 22nd. An accident on the road ended up with us losing three boats, oars, and our trailer. Luckily, no one was hurt in the accident. We ended up losing some of our most valuable equipment, which we desperately needed for the upcoming Fall rowing season.,This is a serious issue for the team. As a student-run organization, we rely on donations and fundraisers to keep our crew ready for every practice and regatta. Without these boats we will be hard pressed to send all of our team to regattas, and without the trailer we have no way to transport our boats. We are of course relieved that no one was harmed in the accident, but we are still torn that we are now in this position, even more so as we prepare to welcome a new novice class of rowers in the Fall.,How Can You Help?,You can help us by supporting Texas Crew Foundations, our alumni association. They are a 501-c3 nonprofit solely dedicated to supporting Texas Crew. Every donation you give us will go straight into helping us rebuild our fleet. Collegiate rowing is a wonderful sport. It permits students to excel during their time in college. We could definitely use your help.,Many thanks,,David Garza,President,Texas Crew

It is an incredible weekend that has now been something that alumni and other friends and families have come to join us from all over.  The funds will be used to bus 60+ players and staff, hotels for Baltimore and NYC, meals, and tickets for tours of the 9/11 Memorial. Anything extra will be donated!

                        Steve is Husband to Christine and Dad to Brooke & Kyle, and is the family's sole bread winner (Christine has serious medical issues which make full-time employment impossible).    Steve is a proud member of the baseball umpiring community, a valued member of the Orange County Baseball Officials Association (OCBOA), and works various levels of collegiate baseball.   So well-regarded is Steve, that he was appointed to work his first CIF Baseball Championship game this season.   ,On the morning of July 5th, while visiting two umpire friends working a game, Steve suffered a tragic accident when the chair he was sitting on unexpectedly broke, causing his neck to snap back as he crashed on to the parking lot pavement.   He felt some back pain at the time, but shrugged it off and headed to a business appointment.    Just 75 minutes later he began to lose feeling in his legs and realized he could not drive his car, and called 911 immediately and was rushed to the hospital.    By late afternoon he had no feeling from the chest down. It was determined that due the seriousness of his condition, his surgeon felt that his best chance for recovery was to have emergency surgery to immediately remove the herniated disc in the C6-C7 vertebrae of the neck which was pinching the blood vessels in the spinal cord.   If not treated aggressively, the loss of blood flow in the tissues of the spinal column could cause severe damage and limit his ability to walk and to perform basic motor functions.   The procedure took 6 1/2 hours to perform, and his doctor inserted rods & pins to help stabilize the spine.    ,Steve and his family are so grateful for all the love and support they have received from the amazing Umpire community and our incredible family, and friends,  They are thankful for the skill of the surgeon, and for the caring staff at Saddleback Medical Center.   But Steve is just one inning into what for sure will be an extra-inning game.  On Friday, July 13, Steve was moved to a Rehabilitation Center specializing in spinal cord injuries at Long Beach Memorial Hospital.   The tough work is still ahead.   His doctor has given him a 70% chance of walking again.    He has regained some movement to his left side, but nothing on the right side to-date.   Steve is an extremely hard worker, has a positive attitude and has a wonderful support team around him.   He is expected to be in this facility for about a month, assuming progress is made.  ,About a year ago, Steve invested as sole owner/employee of Oasis Senior Advisors. As with any start up, cash flow begins quite slowly.   Currently, Steve is not drawing any salary.   Steve’s medical bills are mounting daily, the family needs your help. The fact is, this could have happened to any of us.    Steve would be the first in line to support family, friends, and those in the baseball umpiring community in any way he could, had the roles been reversed. Steve desperately wants to be back on the ball field, but just being able to take walks with Christine again will bring them both overwhelming joy.  ,Any financial support would be greatly appreciated by this wonderful family. We have a dollar for dollar commitment for the first $12,000 donated and a 50 cents for the second $12,000     Please share this post with whom you think you think appropriate.    Please pray for Steve's full recovery, and to give them all the strength to endure the difficulties and challenges ahead.    We are behind you brother Steve, to support and to lift you.    May God continue to look after you, and for the skill of the caregivers in charge of your case.   ,God Bless !!!

                        TO LISTEN TO THE 24HR PODCAST, STARTING AT 12PM EST THURSDAY, ,:  ,----,Hi there, ,My name is Rembert Browne and I grew up in Atlanta, Georgia. One day in 1993, after a fly ball hit me in the face during tee ball practice, my mother took into the neighboring building (McGhee Tennis Center) to get ice. There, she met William “Coach Wink” Fulton. ,I had nothing to do that summer and Coach Wink told us about his summer camp. And just like that, 25 years ago -- The Summer of '93 -- the beginning of the rest of my life. ,I attended that camp from age 6 until I went off to college, the last few years as a camp counselor. In the 90s and 00s, Coach Wink had a dream of sending the camp, an all-black group of kids from Southwest Atlanta -- many of whom could not afford camps elsewhere -- up to the US Open. ,That dream did not come true when I was a kid, but starting five years ago the first trip finally happened. And even though the trip has become a tradition of sorts, the money has always been tight. This camp, and this man -- coach Wink -- have been responsible for the safety and happiness of thousands of black kids in Southwest Atlanta for over two decades, many of whom have gone on to college by way of tennis scholarships and a few even turning pro. ,Because of how important this camp has been to so many, I want to help out. And in that, an idea: a fundraiser to pay for next years US Open trip. ,But there's more: to get people excited about donating, I'm going to podcast for 24 straight hours, with the hopes of raising (at least) $24,000. The podcast, hosted by Anchor, begins at NOON ON THURSDAY and will conclude at NOON ON FRIDAY. I’ll have guests coming on—friends from all corners of my life—for 30 minutes segments. ,It will be very fun. It will be extremely exhausting. And I can’t wait.

I love to rollerblade and rollerblading across the country has become a dream of mine. However, with this adventure in mind, it is also a tremendous opportunity to raise money for a great cause. ,Like I said in the video above, I’ve decided to dedicate this mission to fundraising money for No Kid Hungry, a national initiative run by Share our Strength.

It's huge in helping learning rates. ,The fact that I even have the opportunity to rollerblade across the country is a culmination of all of the privilege and fortune I’ve been gifted in my life. Not all kids are as lucky, though. So, when I started looking for a charity to dedicate this trip to, I wanted to find one that focuses on giving give kids who may not have been born into as fortunate circumstances a better chance at success. I also wanted to find one that helped on a national scale to reflect my trip across the country. , , does both of those! Through this fundraiser:, For every $1 we can donate to the cause, No Kid Hungry can offer as many as 10 meals to children. ,. This includes food on the road, beverages, sunscreen, rollerblading gear, rollerblading tolls, any maintenance expenses, and some lodging expenses every now and then. If through this fundraiser the 10% I receive is way more money than I will need to assist my expenses, I will donate the excess back into the No Kid Hungry donation!, -  Simple as that. Any amount helps to this great cause! (Although if your super cool uncle has that spare million dollars hanging around, don’t be afraid to shoot him a text). Your contribution towards my trip will be greatly appreciated, too. , , - As I travel, I will be looking for some places to crash along the way. If you live in an area I will be passing through or have friends/family that live there, I would sincerely appreciate any helping hand you can lend. , (and image below)!, - Please share this journey with anyone who you may think would be interested in following along! Sharing with your friends and family helps in two ways: ,     1.) Increase exposure for the campaign, which means more money for kids!,     2.) Connect me to new friends who may be able to help on the road - I'll be looking for some backyards to sleep in! , ,I will document my journey, including the people I meet and help me out along the way, as much as I can. Here are all the best ways you can follow my trip:,1.) My website - ,, where I'll host my progress and blog updates,2.) My Instagram account (@mikeonblades),If you'd like, I'd love to hear from you too through my email. Don't hesitate to drop me a line! ,Thank you for reading through my whole spiel and appreciate any support you can lend!,  - Abe Lincoln, 16th President (no need to fact check this, he said it)

                        Since I began playing tennis, it has always been my dream to play professional tennis. One moment that sticks out in particular is my experience x years ago at the Tennis Channel Open in Las Vegas. I got personal with the players, meeting the players, getting to know their stories. This was the moment I decided I wanted to try and play professionally.,My goals haven’t really changed since then, and now that I’ve graduated, its time to pursue that dream of playing professional tennis. I’m excited to see where this journey will take me, but I can’t do it alone. Any donation to help my dream come true would be deeply appreciated. I will keep everyone in the loop, if they’d like to know how its going. Thank you again!,-Korey,Help Korey Lovett reach his dreams!,“Korey is the best college doubles player today,” says John Roddick, UCF Coach and former touringcoach to brother, Andy Roddick. Korey and his partner were ranked as high as #3 in 2018, finally losing a fiercely contested match to the eventual NCAA Doubles Champions, UCLA.,This wasn’t Korey’s first time being ranked for doubles; he previously reached #6 as an All-American at Alabama in 2016. Success in doubles with two different partners in two different years with two different schools speaks to his doubles skills. Korey uses both size and agility to dominant a doubles match. At 6’ 4” he has a cannon for a serve and a world class forehand -- all backed up by “sick volleys,” according to Vanderbilt players observing the NCAA tennis championship.,Korey is also a force to be reckoned with in singles matches. He reached as high as #23 in 2018 afterfinishing #31 in 2017. Korey was a five-star high school recruit after winning the 2014 BB&T Atlanta OpenWild Card Challenge in singles, earning a wild card into the doubles draw.,As graduation nears, preparations begin for the two different levels of the USTA Pro Circuit: Futures ($25,000 purse) and Challengers ($50,000 purse). The Futures have a 32 slot main draw with a 64 slot qualifying draw, while the Challengers have a 32 qualifying draw. Rankings determine the entries into the Pro Circuit events, and all roads from the USTA Pro Circuit lead to the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP).,As for doubles, there is a 16 slot main draw on the USTA Pro Circuit. Korey will pair up with main drawparticipants as well as seeking wild cards. In addition, Korey will be playing in money tournaments andtennis club pro events such as the Firehouse $12,500 Doubles where the UCF pair were runners-up in preparation for the NCAA tournament.,The USTA states that the average benefit for a tennis scholarship at a top college program is $94,000 annually. This approximation factors in the costs of coaching, training, travel, equipment and education. Looking forward, the expenses on the 40-week ATP tour start around $250,000. Fortunately, the USTA Pro Circuit is considerably less, but still not cheap. Expenses could run around $143,000 a year with coaching/training, or $60,000 without these expenses, depending upon the number of tournament weeks and provided housing. Here are the following annual expenses provided by the USTA for 20 tournaments:,Travel & Food: $60,000,Coaching & Physical/Mental Training: $83,000,Strings & Rackets: $5,000,Other Living Expenses: $30,000,Korey would like to remain in Florida with access to the USTA National Campus after summer graduation. This will give him access to good climate, competition and free coaching, effectively eliminating the $83,000.

                        ,I,.,On Friday, June 22, 2018, Butch Butler passed away suddenly and unexpectedly, leaving behind Carrie, his wife of 20 years, and two sons, Mackey, 18, and Aidan, 13, who were his absolute pride and joy. ,Those of you who knew Butch, know his family was his life. Throughout the years, he spent every moment he could with his sons. Sports were always a big part of that time. Whether it was Mackey playing basketball, or Aidan playing baseball, Butch made every effort to be there. He traveled near and far to practices, games and tournaments, because nothing made him happier than watching his sons play. When he wasn’t watching them play, they were together, watching their favorite teams play. ,His tragic passing has left a gaping, irreplaceable hole in his family’s hearts and lives. His wife, Carrie, was always his biggest supporter and partner. They shared the same love and commitment to their boys, spending many weekends together at ballparks or in the stands, courtside. This time together changed somewhat when Carrie was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis, and was forced to take a step back and take care of herself. Without missing a beat, Butch stepped up and doubled his efforts with the boys, making sure this change didn’t impact them more than necessary. This was typical of Butch, who would do anything for anyone who needed something.,With his sudden passing, Carrie and the boys are now faced with more than the loss of a husband and father. They are now faced with the loss of their primary income. They are now faced with bills that will need to be paid, at a time when Carrie, who currently works as a Special Education Paraeducator, is not working because it’s summer and school is out. They are now faced with college tuition to be paid for Mackey, who graduated from high school earlier this month. They are now faced with unimaginable financial uncertainty. This GoFundMe page was set up with the hope of easing the burden this former family of four will now face as a family of three. Thank you for your support.

                        ,Vasilisa Komarova had a dream like many of us in the adventure motorcycling community- to ride her bike, with all she needed to survive, up the coast of South America- through Central America and end up in Alaska. This is a famous route traveled by many road warriors every year. She was planning to be in Alaska this spring, but do to a horrible experience in Bolivia her dream was shattered. Vasilisa was physically and sexually attacked and assaulted -the details of her trauma are to disturbing for me to repeat here-but I encourage those interested to read the (above) attached news article about her tragedy (in spanish-use google translate). She ended up having to stay in Bolivia for many months to ensure a trial and conviction of her assualters. This has put an enormous financial burden on her.  From the brief interaction I have had with Vasilisa she seems like a very kind and endearing person- which is clearly evident by the many new friends who have come to her aid in Bolivia. I am hoping our motorcycle community can gather around her as well and help get her back on the road soon and fulfill her dream, while making great friends and getting support along the way.....    ,If you wish to joint the support group let me know- I will add you to the go fund me account. ,Good Luck Vasilisa!!!

Although it’s a “short” film, it took no less than six months to finish the film from pre- to post-production (including filming and editing the project while making my way through the spring semester of my freshman year in high school). I am the Director, Cinematographer, and Editor of the film.

                        Please donate to help post bond for those directly affected by the administration's zero tolerance policy in San Diego! ,In addition to the families being separated at the border, there are countless others from all over the world coming to the United States seeking an opportunity for a better future, only to be detained and charged with a federal misdemeanor for illegal entry due to the administration's zero tolerance policy. ,For those seeking relief through the immigration process, they must first be processed for their federal case. This means their immigration claim cannot be considered until their federal case has been decided or they've been able to post bond. When bond is posted, the person is then transferred to immigration and can begin their case. ,This campaign is aimed to help speed up the process for those awaiting federal prosecution in the San Diego area. After being detained, it can take weeks for a judge to give a trial date and often times pleading guilty is seen as an individual's only means to speed up the process as it can get them out weeks earlier. A guilty plea is an automatic conviction. With bond, individuals can either go to trial or get deported without a conviction. ,Money donated will be used to post bond (ranging from $250-$2500) on a first come, first serve basis and will be going to individuals with no criminal history, limited criminal history (non violent offenses), currently being represented in the southern district of California.  ,When a trial is complete and the individual has made all court appearances, it is our hope that these bonds will be reinvested to the fund to be used to help another person awaiting trail. These federal cases can take up to 3 months to complete so we have set our goal accordingly to account for the fluctuating time frame while still ensuring funds to continue posting ponds. Time is of the essence and funds will be used as soon as they come in. ,Disclosures: ,As excess funds are available, they will be used to post bond for clients in neighboring districts. ,Posting bond does not guarantee that an individual will be granted relief/asylum/entry into the US. Our goal is just to provide the opportunity for them to ask for it. ,A portion of your donation will be used to pay for the fees associated with using a crowdsourcing website that allows immediate access to funds. GoFundMe currently charges 2.9% and $0.30 per donation. ,Additional fees include purchasing a money order (required form of bond payment) and printing/faxing/shipping of bond paperwork/money orders. ,At this time, any and all individuals helping with this campaign are doing so with volunteered time and are not paid out of this fund in any way. ,Thank you for your help! ,

                        All donations will go to the still in process “What Everett Takes Foundation.” Funds raised will help support NICU families, MLD research and causes related to Everett William Graft. ,Everett was born very sick on 4/17/18. He was deprived of oxygen and diagnosed with Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE). Though the reasons that caused him to be sick at birth are not entirely clear, we, and his medical team, were worried about his breathing, how strong his heart was, how his kidneys would recover and many other parts of his body. We remained hopeful when much of his body initially recovered, but it became clear that his brain sustained severe injury that he would not recover from. This made it difficult for him to breathe without life support and unable to swallow or gag on his own. ,In addition, and unrelated to his birth injury, we had genetic testing done during the pregnancy and learned that we are both carriers of a recessive gene for a very rare and fatal neurological disorder, Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD). We knew through amniocentesis that Everett received both of our genes and there was a good chance he would have the disease. But, because we knew about it early we were committed to monitoring him and pursuing early treatments to give him the best quality of life possible. Once Everett was born it was confirmed via testing that he did in fact inherit the disease, although we couldn’t be sure what form until symptoms developed. Due to his brain injury at birth we were told that it would be difficult to decipher whether symptoms he would exhibit would be a result of the genetic disorder or the birth injury and he would not be a candidate for any treatments that could help treat the disease in the future. ,Everett was loved and exceptionally cared for by the entire team at Prentice Hospital, who we worked with to support him while maximizing his comfort, which was our main goal for his care. We spent each of the 36 days we had with him soaking up every moment - snuggling, talking, reading, singing and loving on him. He passed away peacefully on 5/23/18 with us by his side. We let him know it was okay to let go and that we would all be okay. He is no longer sick or in pain and has changed our lives forever. He will live on through us and by helping others through this foundation.,Get to know Everett on instagram: @what_everett_takes

We are providing the First Responders breakfast, lunch, snacks & dinner for as long as it takes.,We are getting an overwhelming response from so many offering food & donations, thank you so much, but in order to control the quantities of each item received we thought it would be easier for us to order what we need and have our vendors deliverer it directly to us.

                        For months, thousands of volunteers, sponsors, contestants, parents, and supports have voiced their opposition to the current leadership of the Miss America Organization. We do not protest because of change, we protest because there is a blatant lack of transparency, integrity, and good governance in those managing the organization. We have reviewed this matter with qualified legal counsel and will be filing a legal complaint with affected State Organizations advocating for a restoration of the values of Miss America very soon. The complaint will set out causes of action for bad faith and injunctive relief, among others. It is our hope that the collective efforts of the many stakeholders will save Miss America. #InvestInIntegrity #SaveMAO
 
Purpose of funding: 
To support legal action on behalf of willing State Organizations; and then 
To support necessary public relations services to help restore public trust and respect in the governance of the Miss America Organization. 
We commit that the new leadership we seek will:
Incorporate stakeholder groups as real and permanent partners in order to continue the progress and sustainability of the Miss America brand and values. These stakeholder groups include the Miss America Sisterhood, State Delegations (inclusive of Local volunteers), and MASTA. 
Create and streamline the governance structure into a transparent system which integrates publicly recognized good governing practices in local, state, and the national level. 
Review and amend all official documentation and contracts, striking any and all language that dictates that the involvement of individuals, State Organizations, and State Contestants, and Miss America can be amended “with or without cause.”
Embrace changes needed to engage growth among participants, educational partners, sponsors, and volunteers without compromising stakeholders and the integrity of the organization.
Market and promote the cause-oriented young women of the organization who are achieving educational and career successes while also delivering community impact. 
Strive to create a nationally televised event which upholds the existing rules of competition so that all contestants and state licensees are aware of the competition elements at least 60 days prior to competition.
Commit to providing participants the opportunity to showcase their talent, communication skills, style, and physical fitness during competitions at every level.
Leverage any unused funds raised to support the goals and commitments as stated above. If for any reason, these goals cannot be met under the current Miss America Organization, these funds will go towards a new organization that will maintain all of the guarantees as previously stated. 
There is no more time to waste! We need to act now to preserve our beloved organization and facilitate a fair and transparent transition to bring credible leadership which secure the continued success of the Miss America Organization. Please consider a donation (which can be anonymous) and help us exceed our goal! Together we can save Miss America!

                        I'm reaching out to the larger community for help. Everyday we see lots of people illegally denied the right to claim asylum and stranded on the Brownsville Matamoros International Bridge and dropped off at the Brownsville bus station with no money, no phone, no clothes, and no food. The cost of buying premade food is expensive. I want to change that by cooking hot meals to take to the Brownsville - Matamoros bridges and to have hot meals for the asylum seekers after ICE leaves them stranded at the bus stop. The reason I put the goal at $12000 is the place I found is 500 a month and that would cover the year lease and alot of the food and drink cost. The property is located next to the bridge and the bus station making it an ideal spot for delivering food and storing care packages. I'll keep updates and pictures as this becomes a reality. Thank you and God bless.

After the show, Fati was diagnosed with Ewing’s Sarcoma, a rare type of cancer that affects bone and soft tissue. She put her dreams of opening a restaurant, and life on hold while she went through treatment. ,Fati went through months of aggressive chemotherapy, sharing her journey and struggles with us along the way. She beat the odds, finally being declared cancer-free and ready to get on with her life and cooking. During a follow-up screening, her doctors found that the cancer had returned with force and is now spreading through her hip and femur. With or without treatment, they have given her one year to live. ,Fati wrote a poignant article in , detailing her hopes of spending this year living, and finally getting to eat at the restaurants she has dreamed of (from casual places in Queens to Noma in Copenhagen). ,Let’s join together in helping Fati experience all that life has to offer this year. She has so bravely and courageously shared so much of herself with us, inspiring so many to keep fighting and reminding us to appreciate life. Let’s help her get the most out of the life she has been given!,With sincere love and gratitude,,#teamfati,**Fati will receive 100% of money raised, any money she does not use will be donated to the Sarcoma Foundation of America to help find a cure for this rare cancer.

                        7/3 UPDATE, WE MADE OUR CROWFUNDING GOAL!!!!! THANKS SOO MUCH TO EVERYONE THAT WAS A PART OF THIS:  WHETHER YOU KICKED IN,  SPREAD THE WORD,  CAME IN AND SHOWED LOVE, YALL MADE IT HAPPEN!,We are still working out the business of finalizing the purchase, we will post an update when its complete!,related press:, , ,+       +       +       +       +,2701 Fruitvale Ave, a mixed-use building with low income residential tenants that is also the home to our beloved project Hasta Muerte Coffee, is being sold to the highest bidder RIGHT NOW, and we have one chance to raise enough money to buy it.  We're asking you to donate what you can to help us secure the project's future in this time of skyrocketing rent and gentrification. ,Hasta Muerte Coffee is a POC worker-owned cooperative coffee shop, bookstore, and community space in the Fruitvale neighborhood of Oakland, California. We, the collective, are rooted in liberatory action and solidarity, and believe that safer spaces are possible for our communities.  Recently we received media attention for not serving coffee to uniformed police officers, in a policy upholding those values. We held our ground under pressure from politicians, law enforcement, right wing extremists, and the media, with an outpour of support from communities from all over the world who understood the stance we took. ,The Collective is working with the Oakland Community Land Trust to buy the building in an alternative ownership structure that combats community deterioration through the acquisition and stewardship of land and affordable housing to permanently benefit low income residents.,The owner of the property knew that the year of labor we put into transforming the building would add to its value and they are making quick moves to capitalize off of our efforts. Luckily, we included in our lease agreement something called ""first right of refusal"", meaning that if it was sold we would have the right to match that deal and buy the building ourselves. An offer came in so we are exercising that right, with our lawyer, a land trust, and you, the community at our backs. ,The money collected here on this YouCaring page is essential to our ability to remain here for the long term without threat of market driven rent hikes and the displacement of our shop and the other tenants.,FAQ,Is this donation Tax Deductible?,- Yes! This campaign is supported by the Oakland Community Land Trust, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.  A receipt will automatically be sent to you for tax filing in 2018.,What happens if we raise more than our goal?,- We are taking out huge loans, and any excess support will be used to reduce those loans and our monthly payments, making the project more stable for the long term!,What if we are not able to buy the building?,- Donations will be used to financially bolster the cooperative towards its long term viability. ,2701 Fruitvale Ave in Oakland, CA, is a mixed-use building with two low-income residential units that is also the home to a Hasta Muerte Coffee, collectively owned and operated coffee shop and bookstore. Hasta Muerte is much more than a small business; it is an emerging non-profit and community resource center. We are helping to meet out community’s need for gather space by hosting events like meetings, workshops, fundraisers, and more. This loan would afford would would afford our coffee shop/community center and the current low-income tenants upstairs a stable home in a time of skyrocketing Oakland rents, through acquisition of the building in partnership with Oakland Community Land Trust. ,As noted, we have an incredibly short timeframe to buy. Our landlord received an offer for the building, but we negotiated a first right of refusal in our lease and have the option to purchase by matching the offer within weeks. It is imperative to our project that we do everything possible to retain some of the added value that we poured into this building, and evade impending displacement due to market rent increases.,The Hasta Muerte collective and supporters invested $50,000 into the space, paid thousands in city permitting and zoning fees, and donated thousands hours of sweat equity to make the space much of the value that it is today. The current owners of the building, purchased it in 2013 for $390,000. Knowing the owner would decide to sell eventually, and that all this hard work and investment would be needed to realize the vision for the space, we added a first right of refusal to our rental contract when we signed the lease. A short 18 months later, only 4 months after our grand opening, the building went on the market for $1,070,000 and we were devastated. The owners have decided to flip the building now that there is an attractive business and community space in the storefront unit and will profit from the hard work and community efforts that went into making the space over the last year and a half. New ownership will likely double or triple our rent as is common in Oakland commercial spaces and topple our vision of holding space that is committed to more than just a bottom line as a small business. With your help we can secure and continue to develop this sanctuary space for the long term, hast la muerte!,

                        ,The Austin Veteran's Outpatient Clinic is a vast complex with more than 250 handicapped parking places in a designated handicapped parking lot the size of a football field. In total there are more than 1500 parking places. ,The facility runs a 6 person golf cart driven by volunteers to help transport Veterans with mobility issues and their families, in some cases more than 200 yards. The current carts are older model vehicles which are frequently in and out of maintenance due to prolonged wear and tear along with age. When carts are out of service, Veterans must walk the distance to and from the building for their medical treatment often in the Texas summer heat. ,-Larry, a patient at the Austin Veteran's Outpatient Clinic explains why the parking lot shuttle is important for his visits.  A 22-year Marine veteran who served in Vietnam and was awarded a Purple Heart, Larry suffers severe arthritis as a result of time spent as a POW during Vietnam.  He has recently had back surgery to alleviate some of this pain but is still waiting for staples to be removed.  As a former POW, Larry lives by the motto,which is why he agreed to speak on behalf of the veterans who use the parking lot shuttle service.  ,(Current cart - upholstery condition, flooring condition presents a tripping hazard),Many of the Veterans are of advanced age - war Veterans from WWII, Vietnam and Korea - and still others suffer from injuries from service during Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF).,The cost of a single electric cart begins at $15,000 but can run higher depending on added features (safety lights, inclement weather curtains).  It should be noted that funding for a new cart with a service plan is low on the priority list of items to be purchased by/for the clinic when compared to medical equipment.  The current carts were purchased as part of the construction of the new VA facility and there are no funds appropriated for the purchase of new carts.,It is our hope that we can raise enough money to purchase at least one new electric cart with a local service plan , during this campaign.  Any amount you wish to donate is appreciated and will greatly assist us in our efforts to ease the lives of the men and women who've bravely and gallantly supported our freedom over the past decades.,As memorial day approaches, we thank you for your caring, concern and support of our country's Veterans.,Thank you, Kate and Rich,

                        ,  Who is Josh?,Josh, like so many 15 year old boys, enjoys sports, video games and hanging out with friends, but he is so much more than that. He is a loving brother in a family of eight children, he is someone who delights in the trappings of the outdoors, and has a thirst for both knowledge and adventure. He loves God, family and friends. But most of all he makes everyone around him smile.,What Happened?,On Saturday, September 15th Josh received a life altering diagnosis during a routine eye exam. Expecting to walk away from the checkup with a prescription for glasses, he was instead told that in mere weeks/months he would likely be blind. The news was devastating to say the least, but Josh has held strong, grounding himself in his faith, determined to trust God through it all. Josh has amazing family and friends that have surrounded him with love, prayers, talks, and loads of fun and games.   ,Josh’s diagnosis of Leber’s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy, LHON or Leber’s disease, came months after his initial symptoms which had manifest in June. The symptoms, blotchy vision in one eye, were originally thought to be linked to dehydration as they came about during a basketball game. Though Josh continued to struggle with his vision as school started an appointment was set with an eye doctor. It was at this time Josh was informed of his impending loss of sight. ,For Josh, time with his vision is likely short. After losing sight in the first eye, a person with Leber’s disease can expect to lose sight in the second eye about eight weeks later. Josh started losing sight in his left eye back in June nearly 12 weeks ago. It would seem he is on borrowed time. Each day is a gift from God.  ,Why He Needs Your Help,Josh wants nothing more than to use the remaining time with his vision to its fullest. He wants to spend time with his family and seeing some of the wonders scattered across the United States. Growing up in such a large family, travel expenses have made it difficult for Josh to travel beyond the nearby states. He has never seen the ocean, mountains, or desert, three places he longs to see before it's too late. It is here that he needs help. Travel and lodging can be expensive especially when an entire family of eight children is involved. Josh wants so badly to share the remaining time of his sight with his family, even as the marvels of the world call out and the time with his vision shrinks. Please help Josh to experience these marvels with his family at his side.,Ways you can help: share, give, pray.,Whatever way you chose to help we are grateful to have your support.,Thank you!,Blessings From the Bangert Bunch,To learn more about Josh’s condition go to WWW.LHON.ORG,Josh’s Vision Bucket List,Snorkeling,Mountains,Ocean,California,Desert,Mount Rushmore,Badlands,Chicago Bulls Game,Jet Skiing,Northern Lights,Saint Louis Cardinals Game at Busch Stadium,Skydiving,White Water Rafting,Alpine Slides,Niagara Falls,     ,How the Funds Will Be Allocated,51% Travel,23% Lodging,19% Meals,7%  Activities,

                        For the last six years, Jill Anoia has been a part of our real estate sales team and has touched so many with her professionalism, leadership, hard work, and service. If you know me or Matt, then there’s little doubt you haven’t heard of or have been helped by Jill. She runs the ship. She is a part of our family. Our team sold more than 200 houses last year, and she had her hand in every single transaction. She gives her all every day at work, but that’s not all. Jill, her husband Steve, and their sons, Gabe, 14, and Chase, 11, have become a part of our family and our village.,The Anoias are thoughtful, selfless, and steadfast community leaders. They have made a huge impact in the lives of so many. In 2015, Jill was searching for ways their two sons could give of their time and energy to serve others. She called shelters and many service organizations only to learn the minimum ages for volunteers were most often 14 or so. With that, she decided to figure something out on her own. That December, she had gathered about 35 kids to execute a day of R.A.C.K. (Random Acts of Christmas Kindness). They caroled, they left candy canes on car doors, the left quarters in machines at laundromats, they helped folks carry groceries and load them into cars. Anything they could think of to brighten someone’s day and spread kindness. It was wonderful, and her boys were inspired along with her. So, they just didn’t stop. Jill put her head down and got to work. By the next December, they had gathered 400 children to serve and created an entire charitable organization and movement aimed at giving children the opportunity and encouraging them to serve in their own backyards. ,  is now a year-round organization, and in 2017, it grew to 700 children throughout multiple school districts and two counties. Seven hundred kids blasted out into the community the first Saturday in December to spread kindness at animal shelters, nursing homes, grocery stores, hospitals … everywhere! To make an impact on not only those who run into the kindness, but the children themselves. Jill has poured thousands and thousands of hours into the founding, building, and growing of this movement. This year, she was nominated as one of Citadel FCU’s volunteers of the year and interviewed by numerous written publications and recognized by WMMR’s Preston and Steve Show.  And, she’s not done yet!,Unfortunately, in February of this year, the Anoias’ world came to a screeching halt. In May of 2017, Steve was starting to have a bit of trouble with his speech. He was slurring his words a little, and it was beginning to worry them. They went from doctor to doctor with no answers, all the while Steve’s speech kept getting worse and worse. Until finally, at Temple Hospital, they found the answer no family deserves. Steve, at just 39, has ALS. There is no cure for ALS, little treatment, and many unknowns about how quickly it will progress in each individual. ,In the face of all of this, Jill and Steve are blowing everyone away with their selflessness once again. Within weeks of his diagnosis, Steve had sold hundreds of #ALSsucks bracelets to benefit Hope for ALS, and next month, they have organized and are hosting a huge cornhole tournament with more than 60 teams for the same cause. Instead of sitting around wallowing in questions – like Why me? and Why our family? – they turned their attention to finding ways to ease the pain of others faced with the same prognosis. Steve is even sharing his battle to bring awareness here at , . ,For years, while giving of their time to others, the Anoias have been quietly but steadfastly working toward their goal of owning their own home. Steve, in particular, wants to show his boys that through hard work and perseverance, homeownership is possible for their family. They have spent years paying off debts, building wonderful credit, and were working on saving for their down payment. Unfortunately, now, the reality is they aren’t sure how much longer Steve will be able to work and what care he will need in the near future. What we do know is that it’s almost the fall of 2018, and Steve has completely lost his ability to speak. And, as of last month, he can no longer eat or drink and had to be fitted with a permanent feeding tube. Steve has no choice but to communicate with his family and others through a text-to-talk app on an iPad. As a father facing his own mortality and a future without the promise of being there for his family, to help provide for and nurture his wife and sons, his biggest wish is to see them in a home that will be theirs forever. ,Steve is, as anyone would describe him, a family man. He’s at every game for Gabe and performance for Chase. He is and always has been in the front row to support his two sons in whatever their heart desires. He loves his Jill and her servant heart with every nook and cranny of his. They met in college and have a story just like yours or mine – of love and life and dreams and plans. Only now, their dreams and plans have turned to unknowns and “while we still can.” What Steve wants most for his family, now bracing for so many uncertainties, is for them to have the stability of a home to call their own. He wants to know that when the day comes that he can longer work or this horrible disease robs him from his family, they will have a HOME. That the boys will have roots under their feet and a room that is theirs, no matter what. That they will remain in the same schools and be surrounded by those who love them most. Where they can leave their smelly shoes at the door and empty the fridge with their friends. Where they’ll come back to and from college and overwhelm Jill with laundry and love. Where they’ll one day bring home their spouses and children and still feel their Dad’s love is in the walls.,Each day, Jill gives her all in service to others, but first, she loves her family and seeks out ways to make the world better for her sons. Now, it’s our turn to dig deep and help her family accomplish a long-sought-after dream. Allowing a father and husband to breathe a little easier for the life and future of his family as his own breathing becomes more labored.,Now is our chance. Our opportunity. And our obligation to help the Anoia family reach their dreams while their family is still intact. And they can still create memories by God’s grace. To give a loving husband and father and friend the peace of mind he needs for the security of his family as he fights the battle for his life. They need our help for a down payment NOW for a modest home in their school district that Steve can still live in comfortably as his health needs become greater and that Jill can afford on her own when the time comes.

Select sports teams usually cost upwards of $2000. per year. We can help give more kids the opportunity for more years by raising more money. ,Seamus lived a vibrant life filled with love. He touched us with his kind spirit, intelligence, and curiosity. He will forever live in the hearts of all of us who were fortunate enough to know him. We hope that his spirit will live on in the recipients of these scholarships.

                        Our story so far...,This morning, the team of doctors were able to provide an update. As of now, they’re telling us that Georgia has high-risk, or stage 4 neuroblastoma. The cancer has spread to her bone marrow and is likely in other areas of her body as well. We are preparing to conduct further tests within the next 2-3 days to determine exactly where all the cancer has spread. Her future looks like chemotherapy, radiation and surgery. Please continue to pray for Georgia’s healing and for her mommy and daddy’s strength through this very difficult journey.,How it began...,In the past month or two, Georgia began complaining of belly aches. Her complaints were not outrageous and did not seem alarming. It was something as simple as picking her up around her belly to wash her hands at the sink and she would complain that it hurt her belly to pick her up. As the days progressed, she complained more and more. The complaints still, honestly, didn’t trigger any major red flags because we thought it was a simple belly ache that would go away. On Friday, August 3rd 2018, Georgia had a debilitating belly ache. It was a rainy day and Georgia and Abbey spent the whole first half of the day laying around, watching movies together on the couch. Georgia would get up and go play for a short time and then return to the couch and tell Abbey that she ""just didn't feel good today"". A little later in the afternoon, Georgia started crying and complaining that her shoulder was hurting. She screamed and said her belly hurt and then told Abbey that she just needed to go lay down. Georgia walked to the edge of her bed and fell into the bed. She closed her eyes and basically became unresponsive. She was conscious, however, she would not respond to any questions or comments. The only sounds or reactions she gave were when me or Abbey tried to pick her up or sit her up to force her to talk to us. Georgia would scream tell us to just leave her in the bed and that we were making it worse by moving her. Georgia's face became very pale as did her lips and gums. Abbey called the on-call pediatrician, as it was now about 5:30pm or 6pm. The nurse took down the symptoms that Georgia was displaying and advised that she would have the pediatrician contact us. We got a phone call a short time later from the pediatrician stating that we needed to take Georgia to the children's emergency room at Wake Med hospital in Raleigh. ,We got to the ER and they began examining Georgia. Initially they said that nothing looked too alarming and that she possibly had a stomach bug. A second and third doctor entered the room and we got a totally different reaction. They said that they thought she looked very anemic and asked to run some blood tests. The results of the blood were scary. Her red blood count was around 4 (normal is around 11 or 12). The doctor said this red blood count was ""severely low"". We were transferred to UNC Chapel Hill and we were told that there were several other indicators on the blood results that were scary. We arrived at UNC Chapel Hill and began seeing specialists. More blood work, CT scans, ultrasounds and X-rays. The doctors told us that we would need to do a bone marrow biopsy. We were told that the possible cause of the scary blood results were a viral infection or, the scarier version, Leukemia. The ultrasound was completed and we got the results. The doctors found one large tumor in Georgia's abdomen and likely, but not confirmed, other smaller tumors. The doctors explained that Leukemia was probably no longer a concern and that our new, and worse, concern was probably Neuroblastoma. This is a type of cancer that targets adrenal glands and presents itself in abdominal tumors. All of this cancer talk is ONLY what they believe this is, not what is confirmed. We have not received an official diagnosis but the doctors say they would be very surprised if this was anything else. They described the tumors as aggressive. We are waiting for more tests to confirm their suspicions but the reality is that Georgia Mae Webb possibly has cancer. Today's event is a biopsy of the tumor itself. This procedure will provide more details on the severity of the tumors, genetics of the tumor, etc. ,There are a lot of unanswered questions that we have. We understand that there are a multitude of people who may be wondering how this happened or how we got here. I wanted to write this morning to share with you a little bit of our story, most importantly so that you know how to better pray. If cancer is confirmed and that is the diagnosis that we receive, we are confident that this is not our end. Georgia is the strongest little girl I've ever seen and she is a fighter! We believe in miracles.
